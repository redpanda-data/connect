// which may be called by downstream components once any batch or transaction
// associated with the context has been dispatched to an output.
//
// CAVEATS:
//   - This closure may be called any number of times (or never at all)
//   - This closure is called, if ever, when a batch has been dispatched, but
//     _not delivered_. In order to detect when delivery has been successful use
//     the regular acknowledgement mechanism.

// TriggerSignal will call any closures associated with the provided context on
// trigger signal. This should be called by components that are able to
// distinguish between the dispatch of a message and the delivery, and should be
// called once the dispatch has occurred, and is safe to call on any context any
// number of times.
