Writes each individual part of each message to a new file.

Message parts only contain raw data, and therefore in order to create a unique
file for each part you need to generate unique file names. This can be done by
using function interpolations on the ` + "`path`" + ` field as described
[here](../config_interpolation.md#functions). When sending batched messages
these interpolations are performed per message part.`,
