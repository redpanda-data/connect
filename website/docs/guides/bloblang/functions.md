import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

Functions can be placed anywhere and allow you to extract information from your environment, generate values, or access data from the underlying message being mapped:

```coffee
root.doc.id = uuid_v4()
root.doc.received_at = now()
root.doc.host = hostname()
```

## General

### `count`

The `count` function is a counter starting at 1 which increments after each time it is called. Count takes an argument which is an identifier for the counter, allowing you to specify multiple unique counters in your configuration.

```coffee
root = this
root.id = count("bloblang_function_example")

# In:  {"message":"foo"}
# Out: {"id":1,"message":"foo"}

# In:  {"message":"bar"}
# Out: {"id":2,"message":"bar"}
```

### `deleted`

A function that returns a result indicating that the mapping target should be deleted.

```coffee
root = this
root.bar = deleted()

# In:  {"bar":"bar_value","baz":"baz_value","foo":"foo value"}
# Out: {"baz":"baz_value","foo":"foo value"}
```

Since the result is a value it can be used to do things like remove elements of an array within `map_each`.

```coffee
root.new_nums = this.nums.map_each(
  match this {
    this < 10 => deleted()
    _ => this - 10
  }
)

# In:  {"nums":[3,11,4,17]}
# Out: {"new_nums":[1,7]}
```

### `range`

The `range` function creates an array of integers following a range between a start, stop and optional step integer argument. If the step argument is omitted then it defaults to 1. A negative step can be provided as long as stop < start.

```coffee
root.a = range(0, 10)
root.b = range(0, this.max, 2)
root.c = range(0, -this.max, -2)

# In:  {"max":10}
# Out: {"a":[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9],"b":[0,2,4,6,8],"c":[0,-2,-4,-6,-8]}
```

### `throw`

Throws an error similar to a regular mapping error. This is useful for abandoning a mapping entirely given certain conditions.

```coffee
root.doc.type = match {
  this.exists("header.id") => "foo"
  this.exists("body.data") => "bar"
  _ => throw("unknown type")
}
root.doc.contents = (this.body.content | this.thing.body)

# In:  {"header":{"id":"first"},"thing":{"body":"hello world"}}
# Out: {"doc":{"contents":"hello world","type":"foo"}}

# In:  {"nothing":"matches"}
# Out: Error("failed to execute mapping query at line 1: unknown type")
```

### `uuid_v4`

Generates a new RFC-4122 UUID each time it is invoked and prints a string representation.

```coffee
root.id = uuid_v4()
```

### `random_int`

Generates a non-negative pseudo-random 64-bit integer. An optional integer argument can be provided in order to seed the random number generator.

```coffee
root.first = random_int()
root.second = random_int(1)
```

## Message Info

### `batch_index`

Returns the index of the mapped message within a batch. This is useful for applying maps only on certain messages of a batch.

```coffee
root = if batch_index() > 0 { deleted() }
```

### `batch_size`

Returns the size of the message batch.

```coffee
root.foo = batch_size()
```

### `content`

Returns the full raw contents of the mapping target message as a byte array. When mapping to a JSON field the value should be encoded using the method [`encode`][methods.encode], or cast to a string directly using the method [`string`][methods.string], otherwise it will be base64 encoded by default.

```coffee
root.doc = content().string()

# In:  {"foo":"bar"}
# Out: {"doc":"{\"foo\":\"bar\"}"}
```

### `error`

If an error has occurred during the processing of a message this function returns the reported cause of the error. For more information about error handling patterns read [here][error_handling].

```coffee
root.doc.error = error()
```

### `errored`

Returns a boolean value indicating whether an error has occurred during the processing of a message. For more information about error handling patterns read [here][error_handling].

```coffee
root.doc.status = if errored() { 400 } else { 200 }
```

### `json`

Returns the value of a field within a JSON message located by a [dot path][field_paths] argument. This function always targets the entire source JSON document regardless of the mapping context.

```coffee
root.mapped = json("foo.bar")

# In:  {"foo":{"bar":"hello world"}}
# Out: {"mapped":"hello world"}
```

The path argument is optional and if omitted the entire JSON payload is returned.

```coffee
root.doc = json()

# In:  {"foo":{"bar":"hello world"}}
# Out: {"doc":{"foo":{"bar":"hello world"}}}
```

### `meta`

Returns the value of a metadata key from a message identified by a key. Values are extracted from the referenced input message and therefore do NOT reflect changes made from within the map.

```coffee
root.topic = meta("kafka_topic")
```

The parameter is optional and if omitted the entire metadata contents are returned as a JSON object.

```coffee
root.all_metadata = meta()
```

## Environment

### `env`

Returns the value of an environment variable.

```coffee
root.thing.key = env("key")
```

### `file`

BETA: This function is mostly stable but breaking changes could still be made outside of major version releases if a fundamental problem with it is found.

Reads a file and returns its contents. Relative paths are resolved from the directory of the process executing the mapping.

```coffee
root.doc = file(env("BENTHOS_TEST_BLOBLANG_FILE")).parse_json()

# In:  {}
# Out: {"doc":{"foo":"bar"}}
```

### `hostname`

Returns a string matching the hostname of the machine running Benthos.

```coffee
root.thing.host = hostname()
```

### `now`

Returns the current timestamp as a string in ISO 8601 format with the local timezone. Use the method `format_timestamp` in order to change the format and timezone.

```coffee
root.received_at = now()
```

```coffee
root.received_at = now().format_timestamp("Mon Jan 2 15:04:05 -0700 MST 2006", "UTC")
```

### `timestamp_unix`

Returns the current unix timestamp in seconds.

```coffee
root.received_at = timestamp_unix()
```

### `timestamp_unix_nano`

Returns the current unix timestamp in nanoseconds.

```coffee
root.received_at = timestamp_unix_nano()
```

## Deprecated

### `timestamp`

Returns the current time in a custom format specified by the argument. The format is defined by showing how the reference time, defined to be `Mon Jan 2 15:04:05 -0700 MST 2006` would be displayed if it were the value.

A fractional second is represented by adding a period and zeros to the end of the seconds section of layout string, as in `15:04:05.000` to format a time stamp with millisecond precision. This has been deprecated in favour of the new `now` function.

```coffee
root.received_at = timestamp("15:04:05")
```

### `timestamp_utc`

The equivalent of `timestamp` except the time is printed as UTC instead of the local timezone. This has been deprecated in favour of the new `now` function.

```coffee
root.received_at = timestamp_utc("15:04:05")
```
