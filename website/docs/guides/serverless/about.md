Currently the only supported serverless deployment of Benthos is for
[AWS Lambda][lambda], if you are interested in other platforms please
[raise an issue](https://github.com/benthosdev/benthos/issues).

:::info Looking for something less manual?
Rather than bundle the distribution and configs yourself,
check out [makenew/serverless-benthos], which makes quick work of deploying 
a Benthos serverless project on AWS Lambda.
For building and deploying distributions with custom plugins,
look at [makenew/benthos-plugin].
