Reads files from a path, where each discrete file will be consumed as a single
message.

```yaml
input:
  files:
    path: ""
```

The path can either point to a single file (resulting in only a single message)
or a directory, in which case the directory will be walked and each file found
will become a message.

### Metadata

This input adds the following metadata fields to each message:

``` text
- path
```

You can access these metadata fields using
[function interpolation](/docs/configuration/interpolation#metadata).

## Fields

### `path`

`string` A path to either a directory or a file.
