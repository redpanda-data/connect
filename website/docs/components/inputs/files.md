:::warning DEPRECATED
This component is deprecated and will be removed in the next major version release. Please consider moving onto [alternative components](#alternatives).
:::

Reads files from a path, where each discrete file will be consumed as a single
message.

```yaml
# Config fields, showing default values
input:
  files:
    path: ""
    delete_files: false
```

The path can either point to a single file (resulting in only a single message)
or a directory, in which case the directory will be walked and each file found
will become a message.

## Alternatives

The behaviour of this input is now covered by the [`file` input](/docs/components/inputs/file).

### Metadata

This input adds the following metadata fields to each message:

``` text
- path
```

You can access these metadata fields using
[function interpolation](/docs/configuration/interpolation#metadata).

## Fields

### `path`

A path to either a directory or a file.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

### `delete_files`

Whether to delete files once they are consumed.


Type: `bool`  
Default: `false`
