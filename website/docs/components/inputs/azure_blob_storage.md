:::caution BETA
This component is mostly stable but breaking changes could still be made outside of major version releases if a fundamental problem with the component is found.
:::
Downloads objects within an Azure Blob Storage container, optionally filtered by a prefix.

Introduced in version 3.36.0.


<Tabs defaultValue="common" values={[
  { label: 'Common', value: 'common', },
  { label: 'Advanced', value: 'advanced', },
]}>

<TabItem value="common">

```yml
# Common config fields, showing default values
input:
  label: ""
  azure_blob_storage:
    storage_account: ""
    storage_access_key: ""
    storage_connection_string: ""
    storage_sas_token: ""
    container: "" # No default (required)
    prefix: ""
    scanner:
      to_the_end: {}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="advanced">

```yml
# All config fields, showing default values
input:
  label: ""
  azure_blob_storage:
    storage_account: ""
    storage_access_key: ""
    storage_connection_string: ""
    storage_sas_token: ""
    container: "" # No default (required)
    prefix: ""
    scanner:
      to_the_end: {}
    delete_objects: false
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Supports multiple authentication methods but only one of the following is required:
- `storage_connection_string`
- `storage_account` and `storage_access_key`
- `storage_account` and `storage_sas_token`
- `storage_account` to access via [DefaultAzureCredential](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/sdk/azidentity#DefaultAzureCredential)

If multiple are set then the `storage_connection_string` is given priority.

If the `storage_connection_string` does not contain the `AccountName` parameter, please specify it in the
`storage_account` field.

## Downloading Large Files

When downloading large files it's often necessary to process it in streamed parts in order to avoid loading the entire file in memory at a given time. In order to do this a [`codec`](#codec) can be specified that determines how to break the input into smaller individual messages.

## Metadata

This input adds the following metadata fields to each message:

```
- blob_storage_key
- blob_storage_container
- blob_storage_last_modified
- blob_storage_last_modified_unix
- blob_storage_content_type
- blob_storage_content_encoding
- All user defined metadata
```

You can access these metadata fields using [function interpolation](/docs/configuration/interpolation#bloblang-queries).

## Fields

### `storage_account`

The storage account to access. This field is ignored if `storage_connection_string` is set.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

### `storage_access_key`

The storage account access key. This field is ignored if `storage_connection_string` is set.
:::warning Secret
This field contains sensitive information that usually shouldn't be added to a config directly, read our [secrets page for more info](/docs/configuration/secrets).
:::


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

### `storage_connection_string`

A storage account connection string. This field is required if `storage_account` and `storage_access_key` / `storage_sas_token` are not set.
:::warning Secret
This field contains sensitive information that usually shouldn't be added to a config directly, read our [secrets page for more info](/docs/configuration/secrets).
:::


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

### `storage_sas_token`

The storage account SAS token. This field is ignored if `storage_connection_string` or `storage_access_key` are set.
:::warning Secret
This field contains sensitive information that usually shouldn't be added to a config directly, read our [secrets page for more info](/docs/configuration/secrets).
:::


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

### `container`

The name of the container from which to download blobs.


Type: `string`  

### `prefix`

An optional path prefix, if set only objects with the prefix are consumed.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

### `scanner`

The [scanner](/docs/components/scanners/about) by which the stream of bytes consumed will be broken out into individual messages. Scanners are useful for processing large sources of data without holding the entirety of it within memory. For example, the `csv` scanner allows you to process individual CSV rows without loading the entire CSV file in memory at once.


Type: `scanner`  
Default: `{"to_the_end":{}}`  
Requires version 4.25.0 or newer  

### `delete_objects`

Whether to delete downloaded objects from the blob once they are processed.


Type: `bool`
