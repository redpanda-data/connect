```yaml
# Config fields, showing default values
input:
  udp_server:
    address: 127.0.0.1:0
    delimiter: ""
    max_buffer: 1000000
```

Creates a server that receives messages over UDP as a continuous stream of data.
Each line is interpretted as an individual message, if the delimiter field is
left empty then line feed (\n) is used.

The field `max_buffer` specifies the maximum amount of memory to
allocate for buffering lines of data, this must exceed the largest expected
message size.
