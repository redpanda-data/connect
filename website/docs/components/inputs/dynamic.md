A special broker type where the inputs are identified by unique labels and can
be created, changed and removed during runtime via a REST HTTP interface.

```yml
# Config fields, showing default values
input:
  label: ""
  dynamic:
    inputs: {}
    prefix: ""
```

To GET a JSON map of input identifiers with their current uptimes use the
`/inputs` endpoint.

To perform CRUD actions on the inputs themselves use POST, DELETE, and GET
methods on the `/inputs/{input_id}` endpoint. When using POST the body
of the request should be a YAML configuration for the input, if the input
already exists it will be changed.

## Fields

### `inputs`

A map of inputs to statically create.


Type: `object`  
Default: `{}`  

### `prefix`

A path prefix for HTTP endpoints that are registered.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`
