:::caution BETA
This component is mostly stable but breaking changes could still be made outside of major version releases if a fundamental problem with the component is found.
:::
A Kafka input using the [Franz Kafka client library](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go).

Introduced in version 3.61.0.

When a consumer group is specified this input consumes one or more topics where partitions will automatically balance across any other connected clients with the same consumer group. When a consumer group is not specified topics can either be consumed in their entirety or with explicit partitions.

This input often out-performs the traditional `kafka` input as well as providing more useful logs and error messages.

### Metadata

This input adds the following metadata fields to each message:

``` text
- kafka_key
- kafka_topic
- kafka_partition
- kafka_offset
- kafka_timestamp_unix
- kafka_tombstone_message
- All record headers
```


## Fields

### `seed_brokers`

A list of broker addresses to connect to in order to establish connections. If an item of the list contains commas it will be expanded into multiple addresses.


Type: `array`  

```yml
# Examples

seed_brokers:
  - localhost:9092

seed_brokers:
  - foo:9092
  - bar:9092

seed_brokers:
  - foo:9092,bar:9092
```

### `topics`

A list of topics to consume from. Multiple comma separated topics can be listed in a single element. When a `consumer_group` is specified partitions are automatically distributed across consumers of a topic, otherwise all partitions are consumed.

Alternatively, it's possible to specify explicit partitions to consume from with a colon after the topic name, e.g. `foo:0` would consume the partition 0 of the topic foo. This syntax supports ranges, e.g. `foo:0-10` would consume partitions 0 through to 10 inclusive.

Finally, it's also possible to specify an explicit offset to consume from by adding another colon after the partition, e.g. `foo:0:10` would consume the partition 0 of the topic foo starting from the offset 10. If the offset is not present (or remains unspecified) then the field `start_from_oldest` determines which offset to start from.


Type: `array`  

```yml
# Examples

topics:
  - foo
  - bar

topics:
  - things.*

topics:
  - foo,bar

topics:
  - foo:0
  - bar:1
  - bar:3

topics:
  - foo:0,bar:1,bar:3

topics:
  - foo:0-5
```

### `regexp_topics`

Whether listed topics should be interpreted as regular expression patterns for matching multiple topics. When topics are specified with explicit partitions this field must remain set to `false`.


Type: `bool`  
Default: `false`  

### `consumer_group`

An optional consumer group to consume as. When specified the partitions of specified topics are automatically distributed across consumers sharing a consumer group, and partition offsets are automatically committed and resumed under this name. Consumer groups are not supported when specifying explicit partitions to consume from in the `topics` field.


Type: `string`  

### `client_id`

An identifier for the client connection.


Type: `string`  
Default: `"benthos"`  

### `rack_id`

A rack identifier for this client.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

### `checkpoint_limit`

Determines how many messages of the same partition can be processed in parallel before applying back pressure. When a message of a given offset is delivered to the output the offset is only allowed to be committed when all messages of prior offsets have also been delivered, this ensures at-least-once delivery guarantees. However, this mechanism also increases the likelihood of duplicates in the event of crashes or server faults, reducing the checkpoint limit will mitigate this.


Type: `int`  
Default: `1024`  

### `commit_period`

The period of time between each commit of the current partition offsets. Offsets are always committed during shutdown.


Type: `string`  
Default: `"5s"`  

### `start_from_oldest`

Determines whether to consume from the oldest available offset, otherwise messages are consumed from the latest offset. The setting is applied when creating a new consumer group or the saved offset no longer exists.


Type: `bool`  
Default: `true`  

### `tls`

Custom TLS settings can be used to override system defaults.


Type: `object`  

### `tls.enabled`

Whether custom TLS settings are enabled.


Type: `bool`  
Default: `false`  

### `tls.skip_cert_verify`

Whether to skip server side certificate verification.


Type: `bool`  
Default: `false`  

### `tls.enable_renegotiation`

Whether to allow the remote server to repeatedly request renegotiation. Enable this option if you're seeing the error message `local error: tls: no renegotiation`.


Type: `bool`  
Default: `false`  
Requires version 3.45.0 or newer  

### `tls.root_cas`

An optional root certificate authority to use. This is a string, representing a certificate chain from the parent trusted root certificate, to possible intermediate signing certificates, to the host certificate.
:::warning Secret
This field contains sensitive information that usually shouldn't be added to a config directly, read our [secrets page for more info](/docs/configuration/secrets).
:::


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

```yml
# Examples

root_cas: |-
  -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
  ...
  -----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

### `tls.root_cas_file`

An optional path of a root certificate authority file to use. This is a file, often with a .pem extension, containing a certificate chain from the parent trusted root certificate, to possible intermediate signing certificates, to the host certificate.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

```yml
# Examples

root_cas_file: ./root_cas.pem
```

### `tls.client_certs`

A list of client certificates to use. For each certificate either the fields `cert` and `key`, or `cert_file` and `key_file` should be specified, but not both.


Type: `array`  
Default: `[]`  

```yml
# Examples

client_certs:
  - cert: foo
    key: bar

client_certs:
  - cert_file: ./example.pem
    key_file: ./example.key
```

### `tls.client_certs[].cert`

A plain text certificate to use.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

### `tls.client_certs[].key`

A plain text certificate key to use.
:::warning Secret
This field contains sensitive information that usually shouldn't be added to a config directly, read our [secrets page for more info](/docs/configuration/secrets).
:::


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

### `tls.client_certs[].cert_file`

The path of a certificate to use.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

### `tls.client_certs[].key_file`

The path of a certificate key to use.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

### `tls.client_certs[].password`

A plain text password for when the private key is password encrypted in PKCS#1 or PKCS#8 format. The obsolete `pbeWithMD5AndDES-CBC` algorithm is not supported for the PKCS#8 format. Warning: Since it does not authenticate the ciphertext, it is vulnerable to padding oracle attacks that can let an attacker recover the plaintext.
:::warning Secret

:::


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

```yml
# Examples

password: foo

password: ${KEY_PASSWORD}
```

### `sasl`

Specify one or more methods of SASL authentication. SASL is tried in order; if the broker supports the first mechanism, all connections will use that mechanism. If the first mechanism fails, the client will pick the first supported mechanism. If the broker does not support any client mechanisms, connections will fail.


Type: `array`  

```yml
# Examples

sasl:
  - mechanism: SCRAM-SHA-512
    password: bar
    username: foo
```

### `batching`

Allows you to configure a [batching policy](/docs/configuration/batching) that applies to individual topic partitions in order to batch messages together before flushing them for processing. Batching can be beneficial for performance as well as useful for windowed processing, and doing so this way preserves the ordering of topic partitions.


Type: `object`  

```yml
# Examples

batching:
  byte_size: 5000
  count: 0
  period: 1s

batching:
  count: 10
  period: 1s

batching:
  check: this.contains("END BATCH")
  count: 0
  period: 1m
```

### `batching.count`

A number of messages at which the batch should be flushed. If `0` disables count based batching.


Type: `int`  
Default: `0`  

### `batching.byte_size`

An amount of bytes at which the batch should be flushed. If `0` disables size based batching.


Type: `int`  
Default: `0`  

### `batching.period`

A period in which an incomplete batch should be flushed regardless of its size.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

```yml
# Examples

period: 1s

period: 1m

period: 500ms
```

### `batching.check`

A [Bloblang query](/docs/guides/bloblang/about/) that should return a boolean value indicating whether a message should end a batch.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

```yml
# Examples

check: this.type == "end_of_transaction"
```

### `batching.processors`

A list of [processors](/docs/components/processors/about) to apply to a batch as it is flushed. This allows you to aggregate and archive the batch however you see fit. Please note that all resulting messages are flushed as a single batch, therefore splitting the batch into smaller batches using these processors is a no-op.


Type: `array`  

```yml
# Examples

processors:
  - archive:
      format: concatenate

processors:
  - archive:
      format: lines

processors:
  - archive:
      format: json_array
```
