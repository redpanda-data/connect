:::caution EXPERIMENTAL
This component is experimental and therefore subject to change or removal outside of major version releases.
:::
An alternative Kafka input using the [Franz Kafka client library](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go).

Introduced in version 3.61.0.

Consumes one or more topics by balancing the partitions across any other connected clients with the same consumer group.

This input is new and experimental, and the existing `kafka` input is not going anywhere, but here's some reasons why it might be worth trying this one out:

- You like shiny new stuff
- You are exeriencing issues with the existing `kafka` input
- Someone told you to

### Metadata

This input adds the following metadata fields to each message:

``` text
- kafka_key
- kafka_topic
- kafka_partition
- kafka_offset
- kafka_timestamp_unix
- All record headers
```


## Fields

### `seed_brokers`

A list of broker addresses to connect to in order to establish connections. If an item of the list contains commas it will be expanded into multiple addresses.


Type: `array`  

```yml
# Examples

seed_brokers:
  - localhost:9092

seed_brokers:
  - foo:9092
  - bar:9092

seed_brokers:
  - foo:9092,bar:9092
```

### `topics`

A list of topics to consume from, partitions are automatically shared across consumers sharing the consumer group.


Type: `array`  

### `consumer_group`

A consumer group to consume as. Partitions are automatically distributed across consumers sharing a consumer group, and partition offsets are automatically commited and resumed under this name.


Type: `string`  

### `checkpoint_limit`

Determines how many messages of the same partition can be processed in parallel before applying back pressure. When a message of a given offset is delivered to the output the offset is only allowed to be committed when all messages of prior offsets have also been delivered, this ensures at-least-once delivery guarantees. However, this mechanism also increases the likelihood of duplicates in the event of crashes or server faults, reducing the checkpoint limit will mitigate this.


Type: `int`  
Default: `100`  

### `tls`

Custom TLS settings can be used to override system defaults.


Type: `object`  

### `tls.enabled`

Whether custom TLS settings are enabled.


Type: `bool`  
Default: `false`  

### `tls.skip_cert_verify`

Whether to skip server side certificate verification.


Type: `bool`  
Default: `false`  

### `tls.enable_renegotiation`

Whether to allow the remote server to repeatedly request renegotiation. Enable this option if you're seeing the error message `local error: tls: no renegotiation`.


Type: `bool`  
Default: `false`  
Requires version 3.45.0 or newer  

### `tls.root_cas`

An optional root certificate authority to use. This is a string, representing a certificate chain from the parent trusted root certificate, to possible intermediate signing certificates, to the host certificate.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

```yml
# Examples

root_cas: |-
  -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
  ...
  -----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

### `tls.root_cas_file`

An optional path of a root certificate authority file to use. This is a file, often with a .pem extension, containing a certificate chain from the parent trusted root certificate, to possible intermediate signing certificates, to the host certificate.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

```yml
# Examples

root_cas_file: ./root_cas.pem
```

### `tls.client_certs`

A list of client certificates to use. For each certificate either the fields `cert` and `key`, or `cert_file` and `key_file` should be specified, but not both.


Type: `array`  

```yml
# Examples

client_certs:
  - cert: foo
    key: bar

client_certs:
  - cert_file: ./example.pem
    key_file: ./example.key
```

### `tls.client_certs[].cert`

A plain text certificate to use.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

### `tls.client_certs[].key`

A plain text certificate key to use.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

### `tls.client_certs[].cert_file`

The path to a certificate to use.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

### `tls.client_certs[].key_file`

The path of a certificate key to use.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

### `sasl`

Specify one or more methods of SASL authentication. SASL is tried in order; if the broker supports the first mechanism, all connections will use that mechanism. If the first mechanism fails, the client will pick the first supported mechanism. If the broker does not support any client mechanisms, connections will fail.


Type: `array`  

```yml
# Examples

sasl:
  - mechanism: SCRAM-SHA-512
    password: bar
    username: foo
```

### `sasl[].mechanism`

The SASL mechanism to use.


Type: `string`  

| Option | Summary |
|---|---|
| `OAUTHBEARER` | OAuth Bearer based authentication. |
| `PLAIN` | Plain text authentication. |
| `SCRAM-SHA-256` | SCRAM based authentication as specified in RFC5802. |
| `SCRAM-SHA-512` | SCRAM based authentication as specified in RFC5802. |


### `sasl[].username`

A username to provide for PLAIN or SCRAM-* authentication.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

### `sasl[].password`

A password to provide for PLAIN or SCRAM-* authentication.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

### `sasl[].token`

The token to use for a single session's OAUTHBEARER authentication.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

### `sasl[].extensions`

Key/value pairs to add to OAUTHBEARER authentication requests.


Type: `object`
