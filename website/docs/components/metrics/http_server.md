Serves metrics as [JSON object](#object-format) with the service wide HTTP
service at the endpoints `/stats` and `/metrics`.

```yml
# Config fields, showing default values
metrics:
  http_server:
    prefix: benthos
    path_mapping: ""
```

This metrics type is useful for debugging as it provides a human readable format
that you can parse with tools such as `jq`

## Fields

### `prefix`

A string prefix to add to all metrics.


Type: `string`  
Default: `"benthos"`  

### `path_mapping`

An optional [Bloblang mapping](/docs/guides/bloblang/about) that allows you to rename or prevent certain metrics paths from being exported. When metric paths are created, renamed and dropped a trace log is written, enabling TRACE level logging is therefore a good way to diagnose path mappings.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

```yml
# Examples

path_mapping: this.replace("input", "source").replace("output", "sink")

path_mapping: |-
  if ![
    "benthos.input.received",
    "benthos.input.latency",
    "benthos.output.sent"
  ].contains(this) { deleted() }
```

## Object Format

The metrics object takes the form of a hierarchical representation of the dot
paths for each metric combined. So, for example, if Benthos exposed two metric
counters `foo.bar` and `bar.baz` then the resulting object might look
like this:

``` json
{
	"foo": {
		"bar": 9
	},
	"bar": {
		"baz": 3
	}
}
```
