BETA: This component is mostly stable but breaking changes could still be made outside of major version releases if a fundamental problem with the component is found.

Prints aggregated metrics as JSON objects to stdout.

```yaml
# Config fields, showing default values
metrics:
  stdout:
    push_interval: ""
    static_fields:
      '@service': benthos
    flush_metrics: false
    path_mapping: ""
```

When Benthos shuts down all aggregated metrics are printed. If a
`push_interval` is specified then metrics are also printed
periodically.

## Fields

### `push_interval`

An optional period of time to continuously print metrics.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

### `static_fields`

A map of static fields to add to each flushed metric object.


Type: `object`  
Default: `{"@service":"benthos"}`  

### `flush_metrics`

Whether counters and timing metrics should be reset to 0 each time metrics are printed.


Type: `bool`  
Default: `false`  

### `path_mapping`

An optional [Bloblang mapping](/docs/guides/bloblang/about) that allows you to rename or prevent certain metrics paths from being exported.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

```yaml
# Examples

path_mapping: this.replace("input", "source").replace("output", "sink")

path_mapping: |-
  if ![
    "benthos_input_received",
    "benthos_input_latency",
    "benthos_output_sent"
  ].contains(this) { deleted() }
```
