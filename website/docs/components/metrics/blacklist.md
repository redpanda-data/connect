Blacklist metric paths within Benthos so that they are not aggregated by a child
metric target.

```yaml
# Config fields, showing default values
metrics:
  blacklist:
    paths: []
    patterns: []
    child: {}
```

Blacklists can either be path prefixes or regular expression patterns, if either
a path prefix or regular expression matches a metric path it will be excluded.

Metrics must be matched using dot notation even if the chosen output uses a
different form. For example, the path would be 'foo.bar' rather than 'foo_bar'
even when sending metrics to Prometheus. A full list of metrics paths that
Benthos registers can be found in
[this list](/docs/components/metrics/about#paths).

## Fields

### `paths`

A list of path prefixes to exclude. This can be used, for example, to allow none of the child specific metrics paths from an output broker with the path `output.broker`.


Type: `array`  
Default: `[]`  

### `patterns`

A list of RE2 regular expressions to exclude. This can be used, for example, to allow none of the latency based metrics with the pattern `.*\.latency`.


Type: `array`  
Default: `[]`  

### `child`

A child metric type, this is where non-blacklisted metrics will be routed.


Type: `object`  
Default: `{}`  

## Debugging

In order to see logs breaking down which metrics are registered and whether they
are blocked by your blacklists enable logging at the TRACE level.
