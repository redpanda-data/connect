```yaml
whitelist:
  child: {}
  paths: []
  patterns: []
```

Whitelist metric paths within Benthos so that only matching metric paths are
aggregated by a child metric target.

Whitelists can either be path prefixes or regular expression patterns, if either
a path prefix or regular expression matches a metric path it will be included.

Metrics must be matched using dot notation even if the chosen output uses a
different form. For example, the path would be 'foo.bar' rather than 'foo_bar'
even when sending metrics to Prometheus.

### Paths

An entry in the `paths` field will check using prefix matching. This
can be used, for example, to allow the child specific metrics paths from an
output broker with the path `output.broker`.

### Patterns

An entry in the `patterns` field will be parsed as an RE2 regular
expression and tested against each metric path. This can be used, for example,
to allow all latency based metrics with the pattern `.*\.latency`.

### Debugging

In order to see logs breaking down which metrics are registered and whether they
pass your whitelists enable logging at the TRACE level.
