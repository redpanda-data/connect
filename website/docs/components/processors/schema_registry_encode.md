This component is mostly stable but breaking changes could still be made outside of major version releases if a fundamental problem with the component is found.

Automatically encodes and validates messages with schemas from a Confluent Schema Registry service.

Encodes messages automatically from schemas obtains from a [Confluent Schema Registry service](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/schema-registry/index.html) by polling the service for the latest schema version for target subjects.

If a message fails to encode under the schema then it will remain unchanged and the error can be caught using error handling methods outlined [here](/docs/configuration/error_handling).

Currently only Avro schemas are supported.

### Avro JSON Format

By default this processor expects documents formatted as [Avro JSON](https://avro.apache.org/docs/current/specification/_print/#json-encoding) when encoding with Avro schemas. In this format the value of a union is encoded in JSON as follows:

- if its type is `null`, then it is encoded as a JSON `null`;
- otherwise it is encoded as a JSON object with one name/value pair whose name is the type's name and whose value is the recursively encoded value. For Avro's named types (record, fixed or enum) the user-specified name is used, for other types the type name is used.

For example, the union schema `["null","string","Foo"]`, where `Foo` is a record name, would encode:

- `null` as `null`;
- the string `"a"` as `{"string": "a"}`; and
- a `Foo` instance as `{"Foo": {...}}`, where `{...}` indicates the JSON encoding of a `Foo` instance.

However, it is possible to instead consume documents in [standard/raw JSON format](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/linkedin/goavro/v2#NewCodecForStandardJSONFull) by setting the field [`avro_raw_json`](#avro_raw_json) to `true`.

### Known Issues

Important! There is an outstanding issue in the [avro serializing library](https://github.com/linkedin/goavro) that benthos uses which means it [doesn't encode logical types correctly](https://github.com/linkedin/goavro/issues/252). It's still possible to encode logical types that are in-line with the spec if `avro_raw_json` is set to true, though now of course non-logical types will not be in-line with the spec.


## Fields

### `url`

The base URL of the schema registry service.


Type: `string`  

### `subject`

The schema subject to derive schemas from.
This field supports [interpolation functions](/docs/configuration/interpolation#bloblang-queries).


Type: `string`  

```yml
# Examples

subject: foo

subject: ${! meta("kafka_topic") }
```

### `refresh_period`

The period after which a schema is refreshed for each subject, this is done by polling the schema registry service.


Type: `string`  
Default: `"10m"`  

```yml
# Examples

refresh_period: 60s

refresh_period: 1h
```

### `avro_raw_json`

Whether messages encoded in Avro format should be parsed as normal JSON ("json that meets the expectations of regular internet json") rather than [Avro JSON](https://avro.apache.org/docs/current/specification/_print/#json-encoding). If `true` the schema returned from the subject should be parsed as [standard json](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/linkedin/goavro/v2#NewCodecForStandardJSONFull) instead of as [avro json](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/linkedin/goavro/v2#NewCodec). There is a [comment in goavro](https://github.com/linkedin/goavro/blob/5ec5a5ee7ec82e16e6e2b438d610e1cab2588393/union.go#L224-L249), the [underlining library used for avro serialization](https://github.com/linkedin/goavro), that explains in more detail the difference between standard json and avro json.
