While is a processor that checks a [Bloblang query](/docs/guides/bloblang/about/) against messages and executes child processors on them for as long as the query resolves to true.


<Tabs defaultValue="common" values={[
  { label: 'Common', value: 'common', },
  { label: 'Advanced', value: 'advanced', },
]}>

<TabItem value="common">

```yaml
# Common config fields, showing default values
while:
  at_least_once: false
  check: ""
  processors: []
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="advanced">

```yaml
# All config fields, showing default values
while:
  at_least_once: false
  max_loops: 0
  check: ""
  processors: []
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The field `at_least_once`, if true, ensures that the child processors are always executed at least one time (like a do .. while loop.)

The field `max_loops`, if greater than zero, caps the number of loops for a message batch to this value.

If following a loop execution the number of messages in a batch is reduced to zero the loop is exited regardless of the condition result. If following a loop execution there are more than 1 message batches the query is checked against the first batch only.

## Fields

### `at_least_once`

Whether to always run the child processors at least one time.


Type: `bool`  
Default: `false`  

### `max_loops`

An optional maximum number of loops to execute. Helps protect against accidentally creating infinite loops.


Type: `number`  
Default: `0`  

### `check`

A [Bloblang query](/docs/guides/bloblang/about/) that should return a boolean value indicating whether the while loop should execute again.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

```yaml
# Examples

check: errored()

check: this.urls.unprocessed.length() > 0
```

### `processors`

A list of child processors to execute on each loop.


Type: `array`  
Default: `[]`
