<TabItem value="common">

```yaml
# Common config fields, showing default values
merge_json:
  retain_parts: false

The functionality of this processor depends on being applied across messages
that are batched. You can find out more about batching [in this doc](/docs/configuration/batching).

## Fields

### `retain_parts`

Whether messages that are merged should also have their original contents preserved.


Type: `bool`  
Default: `false`  

### `parts`

An optional array of message indexes of a batch that the processor should apply to.
If left empty all messages are processed. This field is only applicable when
batching messages [at the input level](/docs/configuration/batching).

Indexes can be negative, and if so the part will be selected from the end
counting backwards starting from -1.


Type: `array`  
Default: `[]`  

## Alternatives

All functionality of this processor has been superseded by the
[bloblang](/docs/components/processors/bloblang) processor.
