Performs an HTTP request using a message batch as the request body, and replaces
the original message parts with the body of the response.

If the batch contains only a single message part then it will be sent as the
body of the request. If the batch contains multiple messages then they will be
sent as a multipart HTTP request using a `Content-Type: multipart`
header.

If you are sending batches and wish to avoid this behaviour then you can set the
`parallel` flag to `true` and the messages of a batch will
be sent as individual requests in parallel. You can also cap the max number of
parallel requests with `max_parallel`. Alternatively, you can use the
[`archive`](/docs/components/processors/archive) processor to create a single message
from the batch.

The `rate_limit` field can be used to specify a rate limit
[resource](/docs/components/rate_limits/about) to cap the rate of requests across all
parallel components service wide.

The URL and header values of this type can be dynamically set using function
interpolations described [here](/docs/configuration/interpolation#functions).

In order to map or encode the payload to a specific request body, and map the
response back into the original payload instead of replacing it entirely, you
can use the [`process_map`](/docs/components/processors/process_map) or
 [`process_field`](/docs/components/processors/process_field) processors.

### Response Codes

Benthos considers any response code between 200 and 299 inclusive to indicate a
successful response, you can add more success status codes with the field
`successful_on`.

When a request returns a response code within the `backoff_on` field
it will be retried after increasing intervals.

When a request returns a response code within the `drop_on` field it
will not be reattempted and is immediately considered a failed request.

### Adding Metadata

If the request returns a response code this processor sets a metadata field
`http_status_code` on all resulting messages.

If the field `copy_response_headers` is set to `true` then any headers
in the response will also be set in the resulting message as metadata.
 
### Error Handling

When all retry attempts for a message are exhausted the processor cancels the
attempt. These failed messages will continue through the pipeline unchanged, but
can be dropped or placed in a dead letter queue according to your config, you
can read about these patterns [here](/docs/configuration/error_handling).
