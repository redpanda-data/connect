## Fields

### `url`

The URL of the target MongoDB server.


Type: `string`  

```yml
# Examples

url: mongodb://localhost:27017
```

### `database`

The name of the target MongoDB database.


Type: `string`  

### `username`

The username to connect to the database.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

### `password`

The password to connect to the database.
:::warning Secret
This field contains sensitive information that usually shouldn't be added to a config directly, read our [secrets page for more info](/docs/configuration/secrets).
:::


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

### `collection`

The name of the target collection.


Type: `string`  

### `operation`

The mongodb operation to perform.


Type: `string`  
Default: `"insert-one"`  
Options: `insert-one`, `delete-one`, `delete-many`, `replace-one`, `update-one`, `find-one`, `find-many`.

### `write_concern`

The write concern settings for the mongo connection.


Type: `object`  

### `write_concern.w`

W requests acknowledgement that write operations propagate to the specified number of mongodb instances.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

### `write_concern.j`

J requests acknowledgement from MongoDB that write operations are written to the journal.


Type: `bool`  
Default: `false`  

### `write_concern.w_timeout`

The write concern timeout.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

### `document_map`

A bloblang map representing a document to store within MongoDB, expressed as [extended JSON in canonical form](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/mongodb-extended-json/). The document map is required for the operations insert-one, replace-one and update-one.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

```yml
# Examples

document_map: |-
  root.a = this.foo
  root.b = this.bar
```

### `filter_map`

A bloblang map representing a filter for a MongoDB command, expressed as [extended JSON in canonical form](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/mongodb-extended-json/). The filter map is required for all operations except insert-one. It is used to find the document(s) for the operation. For example in a delete-one case, the filter map should have the fields required to locate the document to delete.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

```yml
# Examples

filter_map: |-
  root.a = this.foo
  root.b = this.bar
```

### `hint_map`

A bloblang map representing the hint for the MongoDB command, expressed as [extended JSON in canonical form](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/mongodb-extended-json/). This map is optional and is used with all operations except insert-one. It is used to improve performance of finding the documents in the mongodb.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

```yml
# Examples

hint_map: |-
  root.a = this.foo
  root.b = this.bar
```

### `upsert`

The upsert setting is optional and only applies for update-one and replace-one operations. If the filter specified in filter_map matches, the document is updated or replaced accordingly, otherwise it is created.


Type: `bool`  
Default: `false`  
Requires version 3.60.0 or newer  

### `json_marshal_mode`

The json_marshal_mode setting is optional and controls the format of the output message.


Type: `string`  
Default: `"canonical"`  
Requires version 3.60.0 or newer  

| Option | Summary |
|---|---|
| `canonical` | A string format that emphasizes type preservation at the expense of readability and interoperability. That is, conversion from canonical to BSON will generally preserve type information except in certain specific cases.  |
| `relaxed` | A string format that emphasizes readability and interoperability at the expense of type preservation. That is, conversion from relaxed format to BSON can lose type information. |
