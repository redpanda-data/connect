```yaml
select_parts:
  parts:
  - 0
```

Cherry pick a set of messages from a batch by their index. Indexes larger than
the number of messages are simply ignored.

The selected parts are added to the new message batch in the same order as the
selection array. E.g. with 'parts' set to [ 2, 0, 1 ] and the message parts
[ '0', '1', '2', '3' ], the output will be [ '2', '0', '1' ].

If none of the selected parts exist in the input batch (resulting in an empty
output message) the batch is dropped entirely.

Message indexes can be negative, and if so the part will be selected from the
end counting backwards starting from -1. E.g. if index = -1 then the selected
part will be the last part of the message, if index = -2 then the part before
the last element with be selected, and so on.
