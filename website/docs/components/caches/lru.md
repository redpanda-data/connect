Stores key/value pairs in a lru in-memory cache. This cache is therefore reset every time the service restarts.


<Tabs defaultValue="common" values={[
  { label: 'Common', value: 'common', },
  { label: 'Advanced', value: 'advanced', },
]}>

<TabItem value="common">

```yml
# Common config fields, showing default values
label: ""
lru:
  cap: 1000
  init_values: {}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="advanced">

```yml
# All config fields, showing default values
label: ""
lru:
  cap: 1000
  init_values: {}
  algorithm: standard
  two_queues_recent_ratio: 0.25
  two_queues_ghost_ratio: 0.5
  optimistic: false
```

This provides the lru package which implements a fixed-size thread safe LRU cache.

It uses the package [`lru`](https://github.com/hashicorp/golang-lru/v2)

The field init_values can be used to pre-populate the memory cache with any number of key/value pairs:

```yaml
cache_resources:
  - label: foocache
    lru:
      cap: 1024
      init_values:
        foo: bar
```

These values can be overridden during execution.

## Fields

### `cap`

The cache maximum capacity (number of entries)


Type: `int`  
Default: `1000`  

### `init_values`

A table of key/value pairs that should be present in the cache on initialization. This can be used to create static lookup tables.


Type: `object`  
Default: `{}`  

```yml
# Examples

init_values:
  Nickelback: "1995"
  Spice Girls: "1994"
  The Human League: "1977"
```

### `algorithm`

the lru cache implementation


Type: `string`  
Default: `"standard"`  

| Option | Summary |
|---|---|
| `arc` | is an adaptive replacement cache. It tracks recent evictions as well as recent usage in both the frequent and recent caches. Its computational overhead is comparable to two_queues, but the memory overhead is linear with the size of the cache. ARC has been patented by IBM. |
| `standard` | is a simple LRU cache. It is based on the LRU implementation in groupcache |
| `two_queues` | tracks frequently used and recently used entries separately. This avoids a burst of accesses from taking out frequently used entries, at the cost of about 2x computational overhead and some extra bookkeeping. |


### `two_queues_recent_ratio`

is the ratio of the two_queues cache dedicated to recently added entries that have only been accessed once.


Type: `float`  
Default: `0.25`  

### `two_queues_ghost_ratio`

is the default ratio of ghost entries kept to track entries recently evicted on two_queues cache.


Type: `float`  
Default: `0.5`  

### `optimistic`

If true, we do not lock on read/write events. The lru package is thread-safe, however the ADD operation is not atomic.


Type: `bool`  
Default: `false`
