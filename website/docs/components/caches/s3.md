```yaml
s3:
  bucket: ""
  content_type: application/octet-stream
  credentials:
    id: ""
    profile: ""
    role: ""
    role_external_id: ""
    secret: ""
    token: ""
  endpoint: ""
  force_path_style_urls: false
  region: eu-west-1
  retries: 3
  timeout: 5s
```

The s3 cache stores each item in an S3 bucket as a file, where an item ID is
the path of the item within the bucket.

It is not possible to atomically upload S3 objects exclusively when the target
does not already exist, therefore this cache is not suitable for deduplication.

### Credentials

By default Benthos will use a shared credentials file when connecting to AWS
services. It's also possible to set them explicitly at the component level,
allowing you to transfer data across accounts. You can find out more
[in this document](/docs/guides/aws).
