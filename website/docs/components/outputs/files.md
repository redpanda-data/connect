:::warning DEPRECATED
This component is deprecated and will be removed in the next major version release. Please consider moving onto [alternative components](#alternatives).
:::

Writes each individual message to a new file.

```yaml
# Config fields, showing default values
output:
  files:
    path: ${!count("files")}-${!timestamp_unix_nano()}.txt
```

## Alternatives

The functionality of this output is now supported by the [`file`](/docs/components/outputs/file) output.

In order for each message to create a new file the path must use function
interpolations as described [here](/docs/configuration/interpolation#bloblang-queries).

## Fields

### `path`

The file to write to, if the file does not yet exist it will be created.
This field supports [interpolation functions](/docs/configuration/interpolation#bloblang-queries).


Type: `string`  
Default: `"${!count(\"files\")}-${!timestamp_unix_nano()}.txt"`
