Both the `id` and `index` fields can be dynamically set using function interpolations described [here](/docs/configuration/interpolation#bloblang-queries). When sending batched messages these interpolations are performed per message part.

### AWS

It's possible to enable AWS connectivity with this output using the `aws` fields. However, you may need to set `sniff` and `healthcheck` to false for connections to succeed.

## Performance

This output benefits from sending multiple messages in flight in parallel for
improved performance. You can tune the max number of in flight messages (or
message batches) with the field `max_in_flight`.

This output benefits from sending messages as a batch for improved performance.
Batches can be formed at both the input and output level. You can find out more
[in this doc](/docs/configuration/batching).

## Fields

### `urls`

A list of URLs to connect to. If an item of the list contains commas it will be expanded into multiple URLs.

Default: `false`  
Requires version 3.45.0 or newer  

### `tls.root_cas`

An optional root certificate authority to use. This is a string, representing a certificate chain from the parent trusted root certificate, to possible intermediate signing certificates, to the host certificate.
:::warning Secret
This field contains sensitive information that usually shouldn't be added to a config directly, read our [secrets page for more info](/docs/configuration/secrets).
:::

Default: `""`  

```yml
# Examples

root_cas: |-
  -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
  ...
  -----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

### `tls.root_cas_file`

Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

```yml
# Examples

root_cas_file: ./root_cas.pem
```

### `tls.client_certs`

A list of client certificates to use. For each certificate either the fields `cert` and `key`, or `cert_file` and `key_file` should be specified, but not both.

```

### `tls.client_certs[].cert`

A plain text certificate to use.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

### `tls.client_certs[].key`

A plain text password for when the private key is password encrypted in PKCS#1 or PKCS#8 format. The obsolete `pbeWithMD5AndDES-CBC` algorithm is not supported for the PKCS#8 format. Warning: Since it does not authenticate the ciphertext, it is vulnerable to padding oracle attacks that can let an attacker recover the plaintext.
:::warning Secret
This field contains sensitive information that usually shouldn't be added to a config directly, read our [secrets page for more info](/docs/configuration/secrets).
:::


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`

A list of [processors](/docs/components/processors/about) to apply to a batch as it is flushed. This allows you to aggregate and archive the batch however you see fit. Please note that all resulting messages are flushed as a single batch, therefore splitting the batch into smaller batches using these processors is a no-op.
