Each file is written with the path specified with the 'path' field, in order to
have a different path for each object you should use function interpolations
described [here](/docs/configuration/interpolation#bloblang-queries).

## Performance

This output benefits from sending multiple messages in flight in parallel for
improved performance. You can tune the max number of in flight messages with the
field `max_in_flight`.

## Fields

### `hosts`

A list of hosts to connect to.


Type: `string`  
Default: `["localhost:9000"]`  

```yaml
# Examples

hosts: localhost:9000
```

### `user`

A user identifier.


Type: `string`  
Default: `"benthos_hdfs"`  

### `directory`

A directory to store message files within. If the directory does not exist it will be created.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

### `path`

The path to upload messages as, interpolation functions should be used in order to generate unique file paths.
This field supports [interpolation functions](/docs/configuration/interpolation#bloblang-queries).


Type: `string`  
Default: `"${!count(\"files\")}-${!timestamp_unix_nano()}.txt"`  

```yaml
# Examples

path: ${!count("files")}-${!timestamp_unix_nano()}.txt
```

### `max_in_flight`

The maximum number of messages to have in flight at a given time. Increase this to improve throughput.


Type: `number`  
Default: `1`  

### `batching`

Allows you to configure a [batching policy](/docs/configuration/batching).


Type: `object`  

```yaml
# Examples

batching:
  byte_size: 5000
  count: 0
  period: 1s

batching:
  count: 10
  period: 1s

batching:
  check: this.contains("END BATCH")
  count: 0
  period: 1m
```

### `batching.count`

A number of messages at which the batch should be flushed. If `0` disables count based batching.


Type: `number`  
Default: `0`  

### `batching.byte_size`

An amount of bytes at which the batch should be flushed. If `0` disables size based batching.


Type: `number`  
Default: `0`  

### `batching.period`

A period in which an incomplete batch should be flushed regardless of its size.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

```yaml
# Examples

period: 1s

period: 1m

period: 500ms
```

### `batching.check`

A [Bloblang query](/docs/guides/bloblang/about/) that should return a boolean value indicating whether a message should end a batch.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

```yaml
# Examples

check: this.type == "end_of_transaction"
```

### `batching.processors`

A list of [processors](/docs/components/processors/about) to apply to a batch as it is flushed. This allows you to aggregate and archive the batch however you see fit. Please note that all resulting messages are flushed as a single batch, therefore splitting the batch into smaller batches using these processors is a no-op.


Type: `array`  
Default: `[]`  

```yaml
# Examples

processors:
  - archive:
      format: lines

processors:
  - archive:
      format: json_array

processors:
  - merge_json: {}
```
