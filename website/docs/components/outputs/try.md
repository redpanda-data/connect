Attempts to send each message to a child output, starting from the first output
on the list. If an output attempt fails then the next output in the list is
attempted, and so on.

```yaml
output:
  try: []
```

This pattern is useful for triggering events in the case where certain output
targets have broken. For example, if you had an output type `http_client`
but wished to reroute messages whenever the endpoint becomes unreachable you
could use this pattern:

``` yaml
output:
  try:
  - http_client:
      url: http://foo:4195/post/might/become/unreachable
      retries: 3
      retry_period: 1s
  - http_client:
      url: http://bar:4196/somewhere/else
      retries: 3
      retry_period: 1s
    processors:
    - text:
        operator: prepend
        value: 'failed to send this message to foo: '
  - file:
      path: /usr/local/benthos/everything_failed.jsonl
```
