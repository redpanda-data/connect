Writes files to a server over SFTP.

Introduced in version 3.39.0.

```yml
# Config fields, showing default values
output:
  label: ""
  sftp:
    address: ""
    path: ""
    codec: all-bytes
    credentials:
      username: ""
      password: ""
      private_key_file: ""
      private_key_pass: ""
    max_in_flight: 64
```

In order to have a different path for each object you should use function interpolations described [here](/docs/configuration/interpolation#bloblang-queries).

## Performance

This output benefits from sending multiple messages in flight in parallel for
improved performance. You can tune the max number of in flight messages with the
field `max_in_flight`.

## Fields

### `address`

The address of the server to connect to that has the target files.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

### `path`

The file to save the messages to on the server.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

### `codec`

The way in which the bytes of messages should be written out into the output data stream. It's possible to write lines using a custom delimiter with the `delim:x` codec, where x is the character sequence custom delimiter.


Type: `string`  
Default: `"all-bytes"`  

| Option | Summary |
|---|---|
| `all-bytes` | Only applicable to file based outputs. Writes each message to a file in full, if the file already exists the old content is deleted. |
| `append` | Append each message to the output stream without any delimiter or special encoding. |
| `lines` | Append each message to the output stream followed by a line break. |
| `delim:x` | Append each message to the output stream followed by a custom delimiter. |


```yml
# Examples

codec: lines

codec: "delim:\t"

codec: delim:foobar
```

### `credentials`

The credentials to use to log into the server.


Type: `object`  

### `credentials.username`

The username to connect to the SFTP server.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

### `credentials.password`

The password for the username to connect to the SFTP server.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

### `credentials.private_key_file`

The private key for the username to connect to the SFTP server.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

### `credentials.private_key_pass`

Optional passphrase for private key.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

### `max_in_flight`

The maximum number of messages to have in flight at a given time. Increase this to improve throughput.


Type: `int`  
Default: `64`
