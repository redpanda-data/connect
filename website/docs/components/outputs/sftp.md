BETA: This component is mostly stable but breaking changes could still be made outside of major version releases if a fundamental problem with the component is found.

Sends message parts as objects to a file via an SFTP connection.

Introduced in version 3.36.0.

```yaml
# Config fields, showing default values
output:
  sftp:
    server: ""
    port: 0
    path: ""
    credentials:
      username: ""
      secret: ""
    max_in_flight: 1
    max_connection_attempts: 10
    retry_sleep_duration: 5000
```

In order to have a different path for each object you should use function
interpolations described [here](/docs/configuration/interpolation#bloblang-queries), which are
calculated per message of a batch.

## Performance

This output benefits from sending multiple messages in flight in parallel for
improved performance. You can tune the max number of in flight messages with the
field `max_in_flight`.
