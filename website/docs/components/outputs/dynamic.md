A special broker type where the outputs are identified by unique labels and can be created, changed and removed during runtime via a REST API.

```yml
# Config fields, showing default values
output:
  label: ""
  dynamic:
    outputs: {}
    prefix: ""
```

The broker pattern used is always `fan_out`, meaning each message will be delivered to each dynamic output.

## Fields

### `outputs`

A map of outputs to statically create.


Type: `object`  
Default: `{}`  

### `prefix`

A path prefix for HTTP endpoints that are registered.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

## Endpoints

### GET `/outputs`

Returns a JSON object detailing all dynamic outputs, providing information such as their current uptime and configuration.

### GET `/outputs/{id}`

Returns the configuration of an output.

### POST `/outputs/{id}`

Creates or updates an output with a configuration provided in the request body (in YAML or JSON format).

### DELETE `/outputs/{id}`

Stops and removes an output.

### GET `/outputs/{id}/uptime`

Returns the uptime of an output as a duration string (of the form "72h3m0.5s").
