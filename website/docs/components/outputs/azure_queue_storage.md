:::caution BETA
This component is mostly stable but breaking changes could still be made outside of major version releases if a fundamental problem with the component is found.

Sends messages to an Azure Storage Queue.

Introduced in version 3.36.0.

Only one authentication method is required, `storage_connection_string` or `storage_account` and `storage_access_key`. If both are set then the `storage_connection_string` is given priority.

In order to set the `queue_name` you can use function interpolations described [here](/docs/configuration/interpolation#bloblang-queries), which are calculated per message of a batch.

## Performance

This output benefits from sending multiple messages in flight in parallel for
improved performance. You can tune the max number of in flight messages (or
message batches) with the field `max_in_flight`.

This output benefits from sending messages as a batch for improved performance.
Batches can be formed at both the input and output level. You can find out more
[in this doc](/docs/configuration/batching).

## Fields

### `storage_account`

The storage account to access. This field is ignored if `storage_connection_string` is set.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

### `storage_access_key`

The storage account access key. This field is ignored if `storage_connection_string` is set.
:::warning Secret
This field contains sensitive information that usually shouldn't be added to a config directly, read our [secrets page for more info](/docs/configuration/secrets).
:::


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

### `storage_connection_string`

A storage account connection string. This field is required if `storage_account` and `storage_access_key` / `storage_sas_token` are not set.
:::warning Secret
This field contains sensitive information that usually shouldn't be added to a config directly, read our [secrets page for more info](/docs/configuration/secrets).
:::


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

### `storage_sas_token`

The storage account SAS token. This field is ignored if `storage_connection_string` or `storage_access_key` are set.
:::warning Secret
This field contains sensitive information that usually shouldn't be added to a config directly, read our [secrets page for more info](/docs/configuration/secrets).
:::


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

### `queue_name`

The name of the target Queue Storage queue.
This field supports [interpolation functions](/docs/configuration/interpolation#bloblang-queries).


Type: `string`  

### `ttl`

The TTL of each individual message as a duration string. Defaults to 0, meaning no retention period is set
This field supports [interpolation functions](/docs/configuration/interpolation#bloblang-queries).


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

```yml
# Examples

ttl: 60s

ttl: 5m

ttl: 36h
```

### `max_in_flight`

The maximum number of parallel message batches to have in flight at any given time.


Type: `int`  
Default: `64`  

### `batching`

Allows you to configure a [batching policy](/docs/configuration/batching).


Type: `object`  

```yml
# Examples

batching:
  byte_size: 5000
  count: 0
  period: 1s

batching:
  count: 10
  period: 1s

batching:
  check: this.contains("END BATCH")
  count: 0
  period: 1m
```

### `batching.count`

A number of messages at which the batch should be flushed. If `0` disables count based batching.


Type: `int`  
Default: `0`  

### `batching.byte_size`

An amount of bytes at which the batch should be flushed. If `0` disables size based batching.


Type: `int`  
Default: `0`  

### `batching.period`

A period in which an incomplete batch should be flushed regardless of its size.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

```yml
# Examples

period: 1s

period: 1m

period: 500ms
```

### `batching.check`

A [Bloblang query](/docs/guides/bloblang/about/) that should return a boolean value indicating whether a message should end a batch.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

```yml
# Examples

check: this.type == "end_of_transaction"
```

### `batching.processors`

A list of [processors](/docs/components/processors/about) to apply to a batch as it is flushed. This allows you to aggregate and archive the batch however you see fit. Please note that all resulting messages are flushed as a single batch, therefore splitting the batch into smaller batches using these processors is a no-op.


Type: `array`  

```yml
# Examples

processors:
  - archive:
      format: concatenate

processors:
  - archive:
      format: lines

processors:
  - archive:
      format: json_array
```
