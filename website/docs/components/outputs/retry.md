```yaml
retry:
  backoff:
    initial_interval: 500ms
    max_elapsed_time: 0s
    max_interval: 3s
  max_retries: 0
  output: {}
```

Attempts to write messages to a child output and if the write fails for any
reason the message is retried either until success or, if the retries or max
elapsed time fields are non-zero, either is reached.

All messages in Benthos are always retried on an output error, but this would
usually involve propagating the error back to the source of the message, whereby
it would be reprocessed before reaching the output layer once again.

This output type is useful whenever we wish to avoid reprocessing a message on
the event of a failed send. We might, for example, have a dedupe processor that
we want to avoid reapplying to the same message more than once in the pipeline.

Rather than retrying the same output you may wish to retry the send using a
different output target (a dead letter queue). In which case you should instead
use the [`try`](/docs/components/outputs/try) output type.
