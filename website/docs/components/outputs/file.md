Writes messages to files on disk based on a chosen codec.

```yml
# Config fields, showing default values
output:
  label: ""
  file:
    path: /tmp/data.txt # No default (required)
    codec: lines
```

Messages can be written to different files by using [interpolation functions](/docs/configuration/interpolation#bloblang-queries) in the path field. However, only one file is ever open at a given time, and therefore when the path changes the previously open file is closed.

## Fields

### `path`

The file to write to, if the file does not yet exist it will be created.
This field supports [interpolation functions](/docs/configuration/interpolation#bloblang-queries).


Type: `string`  
Requires version 3.33.0 or newer  

```yml
# Examples

path: /tmp/data.txt

path: /tmp/${! timestamp_unix() }.txt

path: /tmp/${! json("document.id") }.json
```

### `codec`

The way in which the bytes of messages should be written out into the output data stream. It's possible to write lines using a custom delimiter with the `delim:x` codec, where x is the character sequence custom delimiter.


Type: `string`  
Default: `"lines"`  
Requires version 3.33.0 or newer  

| Option | Summary |
|---|---|
| `all-bytes` | Only applicable to file based outputs. Writes each message to a file in full, if the file already exists the old content is deleted. |
| `append` | Append each message to the output stream without any delimiter or special encoding. |
| `lines` | Append each message to the output stream followed by a line break. |
| `delim:x` | Append each message to the output stream followed by a custom delimiter. |


```yml
# Examples

codec: lines

codec: "delim:\t"

codec: delim:foobar
```
