```yaml
output:
  stdout:
    delimiter: ""
```

The stdout output type prints messages to stdout. Single part messages are
printed with a delimiter (defaults to '\n' if left empty). Multipart messages
are written with each part delimited, with the final part followed by two
delimiters, e.g. a multipart message [ "foo", "bar", "baz" ] would be written
as:

foo\n
bar\n
baz\n\n
