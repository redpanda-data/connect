```yaml
output:
  redis_hash:
    fields: {}
    key: ""
    max_in_flight: 1
    url: tcp://localhost:6379
    walk_json_object: false
    walk_metadata: false
```

Sets Redis hash objects using the HMSET command.

The field `key` supports
[interpolation functions](/docs/configuration/interpolation#functions) evaluated per
message of a batch, allowing you to create a unique key for each message.

The field `fields` allows you to specify an explicit map of field
names to interpolated values, also evaluated per message of a batch:

```yaml
redis_hash:
  url: tcp://localhost:6379
  key: ${!json_field:id}
  fields:
    topic: ${!metadata:kafka_topic}
    partition: ${!metadata:kafka_partition}
    content: ${!json_field:document.text}
```

If the field `walk_metadata` is set to `true` then Benthos
will walk all metadata fields of messages and add them to the list of hash
fields to set.

If the field `walk_json_object` is set to `true` then
Benthos will walk each message as a JSON object, extracting keys and the string
representation of their value and adds them to the list of hash fields to set.

The order of hash field extraction is as follows:

1. Metadata (if enabled)
2. JSON object (if enabled)
3. Explicit fields

Where latter stages will overwrite matching field names of a former stage.

This output benefits from sending multiple messages in flight in parallel for
improved performance. You can tune the max number of in flight messages with the
field `max_in_flight`.
