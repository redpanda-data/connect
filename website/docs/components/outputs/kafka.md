The kafka output type writes a batch of messages to Kafka brokers and waits for acknowledgement before propagating it back to the input.

The config field `ack_replicas` determines whether we wait for acknowledgement from all replicas or just a single broker.

Both the `key` and `topic` fields can be dynamically set using function interpolations described [here](/docs/configuration/interpolation#bloblang-queries).

[Metadata](/docs/configuration/metadata) will be added to each message sent as headers (version 0.11+), but can be restricted using the field [`metadata`](#metadata).

### Strict Ordering and Retries

When strict ordering is required for messages written to topic partitions it is important to ensure that both the field `max_in_flight` is set to `1` and that the field `retry_as_batch` is set to `true`.

You must also ensure that failed batches are never rerouted back to the same output. This can be done by setting the field `max_retries` to `0` and `backoff.max_elapsed_time` to empty, which will apply back pressure indefinitely until the batch is sent successfully.

However, this also means that manual intervention will eventually be required in cases where the batch cannot be sent due to configuration problems such as an incorrect `max_msg_bytes` estimate. A less strict but automated alternative would be to route failed batches to a dead letter queue using a [`fallback` broker](/docs/components/outputs/fallback), but this would allow subsequent batches to be delivered in the meantime whilst those failed batches are dealt with.

### Troubleshooting

If you're seeing issues writing to or reading from Kafka with this component then it's worth trying out the newer [`kafka_franz` output](/docs/components/outputs/kafka_franz).

- I'm seeing logs that report `Failed to connect to kafka: kafka: client has run out of available brokers to talk to (Is your cluster reachable?)`, but the brokers are definitely reachable.

Unfortunately this error message will appear for a wide range of connection problems even when the broker endpoint can be reached. Double check your authentication configuration and also ensure that you have [enabled TLS](#tlsenabled) if applicable.

## Performance

This output benefits from sending multiple messages in flight in parallel for
improved performance. You can tune the max number of in flight messages (or
message batches) with the field `max_in_flight`.

This output benefits from sending messages as a batch for improved performance.
Batches can be formed at both the input and output level. You can find out more
[in this doc](/docs/configuration/batching).

## Fields

### `addresses`

A list of broker addresses to connect to. If an item of the list contains commas it will be expanded into multiple addresses.

Whether to skip server side certificate verification.


Type: `bool`  
Default: `false`  

### `tls.enable_renegotiation`

Whether to allow the remote server to repeatedly request renegotiation. Enable this option if you're seeing the error message `local error: tls: no renegotiation`.


Type: `bool`  
Default: `false`  
Requires version 3.45.0 or newer  

### `tls.root_cas`

An optional root certificate authority to use. This is a string, representing a certificate chain from the parent trusted root certificate, to possible intermediate signing certificates, to the host certificate.
:::warning Secret
This field contains sensitive information that usually shouldn't be added to a config directly, read our [secrets page for more info](/docs/configuration/secrets).
:::

Default: `""`  

```yml
# Examples

root_cas: |-
  -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
  ...
  -----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

### `tls.root_cas_file`

An optional path of a root certificate authority file to use. This is a file, often with a .pem extension, containing a certificate chain from the parent trusted root certificate, to possible intermediate signing certificates, to the host certificate.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

```yml
# Examples

root_cas_file: ./root_cas.pem
```

### `tls.client_certs`

A list of client certificates to use. For each certificate either the fields `cert` and `key`, or `cert_file` and `key_file` should be specified, but not both.


Type: `array`  
Default: `[]`  

```yml
# Examples

client_certs:
  - cert: foo
    key: bar

client_certs:
  - cert_file: ./example.pem
    key_file: ./example.key
```

### `tls.client_certs[].cert`

A plain text certificate to use.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

### `tls.client_certs[].key`

A plain text certificate key to use.

A plain text password for when the private key is password encrypted in PKCS#1 or PKCS#8 format. The obsolete `pbeWithMD5AndDES-CBC` algorithm is not supported for the PKCS#8 format. Warning: Since it does not authenticate the ciphertext, it is vulnerable to padding oracle attacks that can let an attacker recover the plaintext.

password: ${PASSWORD}
```

### `sasl.access_token`

A static OAUTHBEARER access token


Type: `string`

target_version: 3.1.0
```

### `rack_id`

```yml
# Examples

static_headers:
  first-static-header: value-1
  second-static-header: value-2
```

Provide a list of explicit metadata key prefixes to be excluded when adding metadata to sent messages.


Type: `array`  
Default: `[]`  

### `inject_tracing_map`

EXPERIMENTAL: A [Bloblang mapping](/docs/guides/bloblang/about) used to inject an object containing tracing propagation information into outbound messages. The specification of the injected fields will match the format used by the service wide tracer.


Type: `string`  
Requires version 3.45.0 or newer  

```yml
# Examples

inject_tracing_map: meta = @.merge(this)

inject_tracing_map: root.meta.span = this
```

### `max_in_flight`

The maximum number of messages to have in flight at a given time. Increase this to improve throughput.

### `retry_as_batch`

When enabled forces an entire batch of messages to be retried if any individual message fails on a send, otherwise only the individual messages that failed are retried. Disabling this helps to reduce message duplicates during intermittent errors, but also makes it impossible to guarantee strict ordering of messages.


Type: `bool`  
Default: `false`  

### `batching`

Allows you to configure a [batching policy](/docs/configuration/batching).


Type: `object`  

```yml
# Examples

batching:
  byte_size: 5000
  count: 0
  period: 1s

batching:
  count: 10
  period: 1s

batching:
  check: this.contains("END BATCH")
  count: 0
  period: 1m
```

### `batching.count`

A number of messages at which the batch should be flushed. If `0` disables count based batching.


Type: `int`  
Default: `0`  

### `batching.byte_size`

An amount of bytes at which the batch should be flushed. If `0` disables size based batching.


Type: `int`  
Default: `0`  

### `batching.period`

A period in which an incomplete batch should be flushed regardless of its size.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

```yml
# Examples

period: 1s

period: 1m

period: 500ms
```

### `batching.check`

A [Bloblang query](/docs/guides/bloblang/about/) that should return a boolean value indicating whether a message should end a batch.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

```yml
# Examples

check: this.type == "end_of_transaction"
```

### `batching.processors`

A list of [processors](/docs/components/processors/about) to apply to a batch as it is flushed. This allows you to aggregate and archive the batch however you see fit. Please note that all resulting messages are flushed as a single batch, therefore splitting the batch into smaller batches using these processors is a no-op.


Type: `array`  

```yml
# Examples

processors:
  - archive:
      format: concatenate

processors:
  - archive:
      format: lines

processors:
  - archive:
      format: json_array
```

### `max_retries`

The maximum number of retries before giving up on the request. If set to zero there is no discrete limit.


Type: `int`  
Default: `0`  

### `backoff`

Control time intervals between retry attempts.


Type: `object`  

### `backoff.initial_interval`

```yml
# Examples

initial_interval: 50ms

initial_interval: 1s
```

### `backoff.max_interval`

The maximum period to wait between retry attempts


Type: `string`  
Default: `"10s"`  

```yml
# Examples

max_interval: 5s

max_interval: 1m
```

### `backoff.max_elapsed_time`

The maximum overall period of time to spend on retry attempts before the request is aborted. Setting this value to a zeroed duration (such as `0s`) will result in unbounded retries.


Type: `string`  
Default: `"30s"`  

```yml
# Examples

max_elapsed_time: 1m

max_elapsed_time: 1h
```
