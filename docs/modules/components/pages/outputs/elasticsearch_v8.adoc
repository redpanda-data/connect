Publishes messages into an Elasticsearch index. If the index does not exist then it is created with a dynamic mapping.

======

Both the `id` and `index` fields can be dynamically set using function interpolations described xref:configuration:interpolation.adoc#bloblang-queries[here]. When sending batched messages these interpolations are performed per message part.

== Performance

This output benefits from sending multiple messages in flight in parallel for improved performance. You can tune the max number of in flight messages (or message batches) with the field `max_in_flight`.

This output benefits from sending messages as a batch for improved performance. Batches can be formed at both the input and output level. You can find out more xref:configuration:batching.adoc[in this doc].

Updating Documents::
+
--

When updating documents, the request body should contain a combination of a `doc`, `upsert`, and/or `script` fields at the top level, this should be done via mapping processors. `doc` updates using a partial document, `script` performs an update using a scripting language such as the built in Painless language, and `upsert` updates an existing document or inserts a new one if it doesn’t exist. For more information on the structures and behaviors of these fields, please see the https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docs-update.html[Elasticsearch Update API^]

```yaml
# Partial document update
output:
  processors:
    - mapping: |
        meta id = this.id
        # Performs a partial update ont he document.
        root.doc = this
  elasticsearch_v8:
    urls: [localhost:9200]
    index: foo
    id: ${! @id }
    action: update

# Scripted update
output:
  processors:
    - mapping: |
        meta id = this.id
        # Increments the field "counter" by 1.
        root.script.source = "ctx._source.counter += 1"
  elasticsearch_v8:
    urls: [localhost:9200]
    index: foo
    id: ${! @id }
    action: update

# Upsert
output:
  processors:
    - mapping: |
        meta id = this.id
        # If the product with the ID exists, its price will be updated to 100.
        # If the product does not exist, a new document with ID 1 and a price
        # of 50 will be inserted.
        root.doc.product_price = 50
        root.upsert.product_price = 100
  elasticsearch_v8:
    urls: [localhost:9200]
    index: foo
    id: ${! @id }
    action: update
```

Indexing documents from Redpanda::
+
--

Here we read messages from a Redpanda cluster and write them to an Elasticsearch index using a field from the message as the ID for the Elasticsearch document.

```yaml
input:
  redpanda:
    seed_brokers: [localhost:19092]
    topics: ["things"]
    consumer_group: "rpcn3"
  processors:
    - mapping: |
        meta id = this.id
        root = this
output:
  elasticsearch_v8:
    urls: ['http://localhost:9200']
    index: "things"
    action: "index"
    id: ${! meta("id") }
```

--
Indexing documents from S3::
+
--

Here we read messages from a AWS S3 bucket and write them to an Elasticsearch index using the S3 key as the ID for the Elasticsearch document.

```yaml
input:
  aws_s3:
    bucket: "my-cool-bucket"
    prefix: "bug-facts/"
    scanner:
      to_the_end: {}
output:
  elasticsearch_v8:
    urls: ['http://localhost:9200']
    index: "cool-bug-facts"
    action: "index"
    id: ${! meta("s3_key") }
```

== Fields

=== `urls`

A list of URLs to connect to. If an item of the list contains commas it will be expanded into multiple URLs.


*Type*: `array`


```yml
# Examples

urls:
  - http://localhost:9200
```

=== `index`

The index to place messages.
This field supports xref:configuration:interpolation.adoc#bloblang-queries[interpolation functions].


*Type*: `string`


=== `action`

The action to take on the document. This field must resolve to one of the following action types: `index`, `update` or `delete`. See the `Updating Documents` example for more on how the `update` action works.
This field supports xref:configuration:interpolation.adoc#bloblang-queries[interpolation functions].


*Type*: `string`


=== `id`

The ID for indexed messages. Interpolation should be used in order to create a unique ID for each message.
This field supports xref:configuration:interpolation.adoc#bloblang-queries[interpolation functions].


*Type*: `string`


```yml
# Examples

id: ${!counter()}-${!timestamp_unix()}
```

=== `pipeline`

An optional pipeline id to preprocess incoming documents.
This field supports xref:configuration:interpolation.adoc#bloblang-queries[interpolation functions].


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `routing`

The routing key to use for the document.
This field supports xref:configuration:interpolation.adoc#bloblang-queries[interpolation functions].


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `retry_on_conflict`

Specify how many times should an update operation be retried when a conflict occurs


*Type*: `int`

*Default*: `0`

=== `tls`

Custom TLS settings can be used to override system defaults.


*Type*: `object`


=== `tls.enabled`

Whether custom TLS settings are enabled.


*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `false`

=== `tls.skip_cert_verify`

Whether to skip server side certificate verification.


*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `false`

=== `tls.enable_renegotiation`

Whether to allow the remote server to repeatedly request renegotiation. Enable this option if you're seeing the error message `local error: tls: no renegotiation`.


*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `false`
Requires version 3.45.0 or newer

=== `tls.root_cas`

An optional root certificate authority to use. This is a string, representing a certificate chain from the parent trusted root certificate, to possible intermediate signing certificates, to the host certificate.
[CAUTION]
====
This field contains sensitive information that usually shouldn't be added to a config directly, read our xref:configuration:secrets.adoc[secrets page for more info].
====



*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

```yml
# Examples

root_cas: |-
  -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
  ...
  -----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

=== `tls.root_cas_file`

An optional path of a root certificate authority file to use. This is a file, often with a .pem extension, containing a certificate chain from the parent trusted root certificate, to possible intermediate signing certificates, to the host certificate.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

```yml
# Examples

root_cas_file: ./root_cas.pem
```

=== `tls.client_certs`

A list of client certificates to use. For each certificate either the fields `cert` and `key`, or `cert_file` and `key_file` should be specified, but not both.


*Type*: `array`

*Default*: `[]`

```yml
# Examples

client_certs:
  - cert: foo
    key: bar

client_certs:
  - cert_file: ./example.pem
    key_file: ./example.key
```

=== `tls.client_certs[].cert`

A plain text certificate to use.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `tls.client_certs[].key`

A plain text certificate key to use.
[CAUTION]
====
This field contains sensitive information that usually shouldn't be added to a config directly, read our xref:configuration:secrets.adoc[secrets page for more info].
====



*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `tls.client_certs[].cert_file`

The path of a certificate to use.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `tls.client_certs[].key_file`

The path of a certificate key to use.


*Type*: `string`

=== `tls.client_certs[].password`

A plain text password for when the private key is password encrypted in PKCS#1 or PKCS#8 format. The obsolete `pbeWithMD5AndDES-CBC` algorithm is not supported for the PKCS#8 format.

Because the obsolete pbeWithMD5AndDES-CBC algorithm does not authenticate the ciphertext, it is vulnerable to padding oracle attacks that can let an attacker recover the plaintext.
[CAUTION]
====

A number of messages at which the batch should be flushed. If `0` disables count based batching.


*Type*: `int`

*Default*: `0`

=== `batching.byte_size`

An amount of bytes at which the batch should be flushed. If `0` disables size based batching.
