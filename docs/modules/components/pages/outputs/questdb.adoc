== Performance

This output benefits from sending multiple messages in flight in parallel for improved performance. You can tune the max number of in flight messages (or message batches) with the field `max_in_flight`.

This output benefits from sending messages as a batch for improved performance. Batches can be formed at both the input and output level. You can find out more xref:configuration:batching.adoc[in this doc].

== Fields

=== `max_in_flight`

The maximum number of messages to have in flight at a given time. Increase this to improve throughput.


*Type*: `int`

*Default*: `64`

=== `batching`

Allows you to configure a xref:configuration:batching.adoc[batching policy].


*Type*: `object`


```yml
# Examples

batching:
  byte_size: 5000
  count: 0
  period: 1s

batching:
  count: 10
  period: 1s

batching:
  check: this.contains("END BATCH")
  count: 0
  period: 1m
```

=== `batching.count`

A number of messages at which the batch should be flushed. If `0` disables count based batching.


*Type*: `int`

*Default*: `0`

=== `batching.byte_size`

An amount of bytes at which the batch should be flushed. If `0` disables size based batching.


*Type*: `int`

*Default*: `0`

=== `batching.period`

A period in which an incomplete batch should be flushed regardless of its size.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

```yml
# Examples

period: 1s

period: 1m

period: 500ms
```

=== `batching.check`

A xref:guides:bloblang/about.adoc[Bloblang query] that should return a boolean value indicating whether a message should end a batch.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

```yml
# Examples

check: this.type == "end_of_transaction"
```

=== `batching.processors`

A list of xref:components:processors/about.adoc[processors] to apply to a batch as it is flushed. This allows you to aggregate and archive the batch however you see fit. Please note that all resulting messages are flushed as a single batch, therefore splitting the batch into smaller batches using these processors is a no-op.


*Type*: `array`


```yml
# Examples

processors:
  - archive:
      format: concatenate

processors:
  - archive:
      format: lines

processors:
  - archive:
      format: json_array
```

=== `address`

Address of the QuestDB server's HTTP port (excluding protocol)


*Type*: `string`


```yml
# Examples

address: localhost:9000
```

=== `username`

Username for HTTP basic auth
[CAUTION]
====
This field contains sensitive information that usually shouldn't be added to a config directly, read our xref:configuration:secrets.adoc[secrets page for more info].
====



*Type*: `string`


=== `password`

Password for HTTP basic auth
[CAUTION]
====
This field contains sensitive information that usually shouldn't be added to a config directly, read our xref:configuration:secrets.adoc[secrets page for more info].
====



*Type*: `string`


=== `token`

Bearer token for HTTP auth (takes precedence over basic auth username & password)
[CAUTION]
====
This field contains sensitive information that usually shouldn't be added to a config directly, read our xref:configuration:secrets.adoc[secrets page for more info].
====



*Type*: `string`


=== `tlsEnabled`

Use TLS to secure the connection to the server


*Type*: `bool`


=== `tlsVerify`

Whether to verify the server's certificate. This should only be used for testing as a last resort and never used in production as it makes the connection vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. Options are 'on' or 'unsafe_off'.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `"on"`

=== `retryTimeout`

The time to continue retrying after a failed HTTP request. The interval between retries is an exponential backoff starting at 10ms and doubling after each failed attempt up to a maximum of 1 second.


*Type*: `string`


=== `requestTimeout`

The time to wait for a response from the server. This is in addition to the calculation derived from the requestMinThroughput parameter.


*Type*: `string`


=== `requestMinThroughput`

Minimum expected throughput in bytes per second for HTTP requests. If the throughput is lower than this value, the connection will time out. This is used to calculate an additional timeout on top of requestTimeout. This is useful for large requests. You can set this value to 0 to disable this logic.


*Type*: `int`


=== `table`

Destination table


*Type*: `string`


```yml
# Examples

table: trades
```

=== `designatedTimestampField`

Name of the designated timestamp field


*Type*: `string`


=== `designatedTimestampUnit`

Designated timestamp field units


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `"auto"`

=== `timestampStringFields`

String fields with textual timestamps


*Type*: `array`


=== `timestampStringFormat`

Timestamp format, used when parsing timestamp string fields. Specified in golang's time.Parse layout


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `"Jan _2 15:04:05.000000Z0700"`

=== `symbols`

Columns that should be the SYMBOL type (string values default to STRING)


*Type*: `array`


=== `doubles`

Columns that should be double type, (int is default)


*Type*: `array`


=== `errorOnEmptyMessages`

Mark a message as errored if it is empty after field validation


*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `false`
