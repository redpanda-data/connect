======

The `topic` field can be dynamically set using function interpolations described xref:configuration:interpolation.adoc#bloblang-queries[here]. When sending batched messages these interpolations are performed per message part.

== Performance

This output benefits from sending multiple messages in flight in parallel for improved performance. You can tune the max number of in flight messages (or message batches) with the field `max_in_flight`.

== Fields

=== `urls`

A list of URLs to connect to. The format should be `scheme://host:port` where `scheme` is one of `tcp`, `ssl`, or `ws`, `host` is the ip-address (or hostname) and `port` is the port on which the broker is accepting connections. If an item of the list contains commas it will be expanded into multiple URLs.


*Type*: `array`


```yml
# Examples

urls:
  - tcp://localhost:1883
```

=== `client_id`

An identifier for the client connection.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `dynamic_client_id_suffix`

Append a dynamically generated suffix to the specified `client_id` on each run of the pipeline. This can be useful when clustering Redpanda Connect producers.


*Type*: `string`


|===
| Option | Summary

| `nanoid`
| append a nanoid of length 21 characters

|===

=== `connect_timeout`

The maximum amount of time to wait in order to establish a connection before the attempt is abandoned.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `"30s"`
Requires version 3.58.0 or newer

```yml
# Examples

connect_timeout: 1s

connect_timeout: 500ms
```

=== `will`

Set last will message in case of Redpanda Connect failure


*Type*: `object`


=== `will.enabled`

Whether to enable last will messages.


*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `false`

=== `will.qos`

Set QoS for last will message. Valid values are: 0, 1, 2.


*Type*: `int`

*Default*: `0`

=== `will.retained`

Set retained for last will message.


*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `false`

=== `will.topic`

Set topic for last will message.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `will.payload`

Set payload for last will message.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `user`

A username to connect with.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `password`

A password to connect with.

This field contains sensitive information that usually shouldn't be added to a config directly, read our xref:configuration:secrets.adoc[secrets page for more info].
====



*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `keepalive`

Max seconds of inactivity before a keepalive message is sent.


*Type*: `int`

*Default*: `30`

=== `tls`

Custom TLS settings can be used to override system defaults.


*Type*: `object`


=== `tls.enabled`

Whether custom TLS settings are enabled.


*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `false`

=== `tls.skip_cert_verify`

Whether to skip server side certificate verification.


*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `false`

=== `tls.enable_renegotiation`

Whether to allow the remote server to repeatedly request renegotiation. Enable this option if you're seeing the error message `local error: tls: no renegotiation`.


*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `false`
Requires version 3.45.0 or newer

=== `tls.root_cas`

An optional root certificate authority to use. This is a string, representing a certificate chain from the parent trusted root certificate, to possible intermediate signing certificates, to the host certificate.
[CAUTION]
====
This field contains sensitive information that usually shouldn't be added to a config directly, read our xref:configuration:secrets.adoc[secrets page for more info].
====



*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

```yml
# Examples

root_cas: |-
  -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
  ...
  -----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

=== `tls.root_cas_file`

An optional path of a root certificate authority file to use. This is a file, often with a .pem extension, containing a certificate chain from the parent trusted root certificate, to possible intermediate signing certificates, to the host certificate.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

```yml
# Examples

root_cas_file: ./root_cas.pem
```

=== `tls.client_certs`

A list of client certificates to use. For each certificate either the fields `cert` and `key`, or `cert_file` and `key_file` should be specified, but not both.


*Type*: `array`

*Default*: `[]`

```yml
# Examples

client_certs:
  - cert: foo
    key: bar

client_certs:
  - cert_file: ./example.pem
    key_file: ./example.key
```

=== `tls.client_certs[].cert`

A plain text certificate to use.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `tls.client_certs[].key`

A plain text certificate key to use.
[CAUTION]
====
This field contains sensitive information that usually shouldn't be added to a config directly, read our xref:configuration:secrets.adoc[secrets page for more info].
====



*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `tls.client_certs[].cert_file`

The path of a certificate to use.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `tls.client_certs[].key_file`

The path of a certificate key to use.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `tls.client_certs[].password`

A plain text password for when the private key is password encrypted in PKCS#1 or PKCS#8 format. The obsolete `pbeWithMD5AndDES-CBC` algorithm is not supported for the PKCS#8 format.

Because the obsolete pbeWithMD5AndDES-CBC algorithm does not authenticate the ciphertext, it is vulnerable to padding oracle attacks that can let an attacker recover the plaintext.
[CAUTION]

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

```yml
# Examples

password: foo

password: ${KEY_PASSWORD}
```

=== `topic`

The topic to publish messages to.
This field supports xref:configuration:interpolation.adoc#bloblang-queries[interpolation functions].


*Type*: `string`


=== `qos`

The QoS value to set for each message. Has options 0, 1, 2.


*Type*: `int`

*Default*: `1`

=== `write_timeout`

The maximum amount of time to wait to write data before the attempt is abandoned.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `"3s"`
Requires version 3.58.0 or newer

```yml
# Examples

write_timeout: 1s

write_timeout: 500ms
```

=== `retained`

Set message as retained on the topic.


*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `false`

=== `retained_interpolated`

Override the value of `retained` with an interpolable value, this allows it to be dynamically set based on message contents. The value must resolve to either `true` or `false`.
This field supports xref:configuration:interpolation.adoc#bloblang-queries[interpolation functions].


*Type*: `string`

Requires version 3.59.0 or newer

=== `max_in_flight`

The maximum number of messages to have in flight at a given time. Increase this to improve throughput.


*Type*: `int`

*Default*: `64`
