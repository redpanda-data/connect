Ingest data into Snowflake using Snowpipe Streaming.

[%header,format=dsv]
|===
Snowflake column type:Allowed format in Redpanda Connect
CHAR, VARCHAR:string
BINARY:[]byte
NUMBER:any numeric type, string
FLOAT:any numeric type
BOOLEAN:bool,any numeric type,string parsable according to `strconv.ParseBool`
TIME,DATE,TIMESTAMP:unix or RFC 3339 with nanoseconds timestamps
VARIANT,ARRAY,OBJECT:any data type is converted into JSON
GEOGRAPHY,GEOMETRY: Not supported
|===

For TIMESTAMP, TIME and DATE columns, you can parse different string formats using a bloblang `mapping`.

Authentication can be configured using a https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/key-pair-auth[RSA Key Pair^].

There are https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-load-snowpipe-streaming-overview#limitations[limitations^] of what data types can be loaded into Snowflake using this method.


== Performance

This output benefits from sending multiple messages in flight in parallel for improved performance. You can tune the max number of in flight messages (or message batches) with the field `max_in_flight`.

This output benefits from sending messages as a batch for improved performance. Batches can be formed at both the input and output level. You can find out more xref:configuration:batching.adoc[in this doc].

It is recommended that each batches results in at least 16MiB of compressed output being written to Snowflake.
You can monitor the output batch size using the `snowflake_compressed_output_size_bytes` metric.


== Fields

=== `account`

Account name, which is the same as the https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/admin-account-identifier.html#where-are-account-identifiers-used[Account Identifier^].
      However, when using an https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/admin-account-identifier.html#using-an-account-locator-as-an-identifier[Account Locator^],
      the Account Identifier is formatted as `<account_locator>.<region_id>.<cloud>` and this field needs to be
      populated using the `<account_locator>` part.


*Type*: `string`


```yml
# Examples

account: AAAAAAA-AAAAAAA
```

=== `user`

The user to run the Snowpipe Stream as. See https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/admin-user-management[Snowflake Documentation^] on how to create a user.


*Type*: `string`


=== `role`

The role for the `user` field. The role must have the https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-load-snowpipe-streaming-overview#required-access-privileges[required privileges^] to call the Snowpipe Streaming APIs. See https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/admin-user-management#user-roles[Snowflake Documentation^] for more information about roles.


*Type*: `string`


```yml
# Examples

role: ACCOUNTADMIN
```

=== `database`

The Snowflake database to ingest data into.


*Type*: `string`


=== `schema`

The Snowflake schema to ingest data into.


*Type*: `string`


=== `table`

The Snowflake table to ingest data into.


*Type*: `string`


=== `private_key`

The PEM encoded private RSA key to use for authenticating with Snowflake. Either this or `private_key_file` must be specified.
[CAUTION]
====
This field contains sensitive information that usually shouldn't be added to a config directly, read our xref:configuration:secrets.adoc[secrets page for more info].
====



*Type*: `string`


=== `private_key_file`

The file to load the private RSA key from. This should be a `.p8` PEM encoded file. Either this or `private_key` must be specified.


*Type*: `string`


=== `private_key_pass`

The RSA key passphrase if the RSA key is encrypted.
[CAUTION]
====
This field contains sensitive information that usually shouldn't be added to a config directly, read our xref:configuration:secrets.adoc[secrets page for more info].
====



*Type*: `string`


=== `mapping`

A bloblang mapping to execute on each message.


*Type*: `string`


=== `batching`

Allows you to configure a xref:configuration:batching.adoc[batching policy].


*Type*: `object`


```yml
# Examples

batching:
  byte_size: 5000
  count: 0
  period: 1s

batching:
  count: 10
  period: 1s

batching:
  check: this.contains("END BATCH")
  count: 0
  period: 1m
```

=== `batching.count`

A number of messages at which the batch should be flushed. If `0` disables count based batching.


*Type*: `int`

*Default*: `0`

=== `batching.byte_size`

An amount of bytes at which the batch should be flushed. If `0` disables size based batching.


*Type*: `int`

*Default*: `0`

=== `batching.period`

A period in which an incomplete batch should be flushed regardless of its size.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

```yml
# Examples

period: 1s

period: 1m

period: 500ms
```

=== `batching.check`

A xref:guides:bloblang/about.adoc[Bloblang query] that should return a boolean value indicating whether a message should end a batch.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

```yml
# Examples

check: this.type == "end_of_transaction"
```

=== `batching.processors`

A list of xref:components:processors/about.adoc[processors] to apply to a batch as it is flushed. This allows you to aggregate and archive the batch however you see fit. Please note that all resulting messages are flushed as a single batch, therefore splitting the batch into smaller batches using these processors is a no-op.


*Type*: `array`


```yml
# Examples

processors:
  - archive:
      format: concatenate

processors:
  - archive:
      format: lines

processors:
  - archive:
      format: json_array
```

=== `max_in_flight`

The maximum number of messages to have in flight at a given time. Increase this to improve throughput.


*Type*: `int`

*Default*: `64`

=== `channel_prefix`

The prefix to use when creating a channel name.
Duplicate channel names will result in errors and prevent multiple instances of Redpanda Connect from writing at the same time.
By default this will create a channel name that is based on the table FQN so there will only be a single stream per table.

At most `max_in_flight` channels will be opened.

NOTE: There is a limit of 10,000 streams per table - if using more than 10k streams please reach out to Snowflake support.


*Type*: `string`
