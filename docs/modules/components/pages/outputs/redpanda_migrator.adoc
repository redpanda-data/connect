======

The `redpanda_migrator` output performs all migration work. 
It coordinates topics, schema registry, and consumer groups to migrate data from a source Kafka/Redpanda cluster to a destination cluster.

**IMPORTANT:** This output requires a corresponding `redpanda_migrator` input in the same pipeline. 
Each pipeline must have both input and output components configured.

**Multiple migrator pairs:** When using multiple migrator pairs in a single pipeline, 
the mapping between input and output components is done based on the label field. 
The label of the input and output must match exactly for proper coordination.

What gets synchronised:

- Topics
  - Name resolution with interpolation (default: preserve source name)
  - Automatic creation with mirrored partition counts
  - Selectable replication factor (default: inherit from source)
  - Copy of supported topic configuration keys (serverless-aware subset)
  - Optional ACL replication with safe transforms:
    - Excludes `ALLOW WRITE` entries
    - Downgrades `ALLOW ALL` to `READ`
    - Preserves resource pattern type and host filters

- Schema Registry
  - One-shot or periodic syncing
  - Subject selection via include/exclude regex
  - Subject renaming with interpolation
  - Versions: `latest` or `all` (default: `all`)
  - Optional include of soft-deleted subjects
  - ID handling: translate IDs (create-or-reuse) or keep fixed IDs and versions
  - Optional schema normalisation on create
  - Optional per-subject compatibility propagation when explicitly set on source (global mode is not forced)
  - Serverless note: schema metadata and rule sets are not copied in serverless mode

- Consumer Groups
  - Periodic syncing
  - Group selection via include/exclude regex
  - Only groups in `Empty` state are migrated (active groups are skipped)
  - Timestamp-based offset translation (approximate) per partition using previous-record timestamp and `ListOffsetsAfterMilli`
  - No rewind guarantee: destination offsets are never moved backwards
  - Commit performed in parallel with per-group metrics
  - Requires matching partition counts between source and destination topics

How it runs:

- Topics: synced on demand. The first write triggers discovery and creation; subsequent writes create on first encounter per topic.
- Schema Registry: one sync at connect, then triggered when topic record has unknown schema; optional background loop controlled by `schema_registry.interval`.
- Consumer Groups: background loop controlled by `consumer_groups.interval` and filtered by the current topic mappings.

Guarantees:

- Topics are created with the intended partitioning and configured replication factor. Existing topics are respected; partition mismatches are logged and consumer group migration for mismatched topics is skipped.
- Consumer group offsets are never rewound. Only translated forward positions are committed.
- ACL replication excludes `ALLOW WRITE` operations and downgrades `ALLOW ALL` to `READ` to avoid unsafe grants.

Limitations and requirements:

- Destination Schema Registry must be in `READWRITE` or `IMPORT` mode.
- Offset translation is best-effort: if the previous-offset timestamp cannot be read, or no destination offset exists after the timestamp, that partition is skipped.
- Consumer group migration requires identical partition counts for source and destination topics.

Metrics:

The component exposes comprehensive metrics for monitoring migration operations:

Topic Migration Metrics:
- `migrator_topics_created_total` (counter): Total number of topics successfully created on the destination cluster
- `migrator_topic_create_errors_total` (counter): Total number of errors encountered when creating topics
- `migrator_topic_create_latency_ns` (timer): Latency in nanoseconds for topic creation operations

Schema Registry Migration Metrics:
- `migrator_sr_schemas_created_total` (counter): Total number of schemas successfully created in the destination schema registry
- `migrator_sr_schema_create_errors_total` (counter): Total number of errors encountered when creating schemas
- `migrator_sr_schema_create_latency_ns` (timer): Latency in nanoseconds for schema creation operations
- `migrator_sr_compatibility_updates_total` (counter): Total number of compatibility level updates applied to subjects
- `migrator_sr_compatibility_update_errors_total` (counter): Total number of errors encountered when updating compatibility levels
- `migrator_sr_compatibility_update_latency_ns` (timer): Latency in nanoseconds for compatibility level update operations

Consumer Group Migration Metrics (with group label):
- `migrator_cg_offsets_translated_total` (counter): Total number of offsets successfully translated per consumer group
- `migrator_cg_offset_translation_errors_total` (counter): Total number of errors encountered when translating offsets per consumer group
- `migrator_cg_offset_translation_latency_ns` (timer): Latency in nanoseconds for offset translation operations per consumer group
- `migrator_cg_offsets_committed_total` (counter): Total number of offsets successfully committed per consumer group
- `migrator_cg_offset_commit_errors_total` (counter): Total number of errors encountered when committing offsets per consumer group
- `migrator_cg_offset_commit_latency_ns` (timer): Latency in nanoseconds for offset commit operations per consumer group

This component must be paired with the `redpanda_migrator` input in the same pipeline.

```

=== `schema_registry.versions`

Which schema versions to migrate. 'latest' migrates only the current version, 'all' migrates complete version history for better compatibility.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `"all"`

Options:
`latest`
, `all`
.

=== `schema_registry.include_deleted`

Whether to include soft-deleted schemas in migration. Useful for complete migration but may not be supported by all schema registries.


*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `false`

=== `schema_registry.translate_ids`

Whether to translate schema IDs during migration.


*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `false`

=== `schema_registry.normalize`

Whether to normalize schemas when creating them in the destination registry.


*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `false`

=== `consumer_groups`

Sorry! This field is missing documentation.


*Type*: `object`


=== `consumer_groups.enabled`

Whether consumer group offset migration is enabled. When disabled, no consumer group operations are performed.


*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `true`

=== `consumer_groups.interval`

How often to synchronise consumer group offsets. Regular syncing helps maintain offset accuracy during ongoing migration.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `"1m"`

```yml
# Examples

interval: '0s     # Disabled'

interval: '30s    # Sync every 30 seconds'

interval: '5m     # Sync every 5 minutes'
```

=== `consumer_groups.fetch_timeout`

Maximum time to wait for data when fetching records for timestamp-based offset translation. Increase for clusters with low message throughput.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `"10s"`

```yml
# Examples

fetch_timeout: '1s     # Fast clusters'

fetch_timeout: '10s    # Slower clusters'
```

=== `consumer_groups.include`

Regular expressions for consumer groups to include in offset migration. If empty, all groups are included (unless excluded).


*Type*: `array`


```yml
# Examples

include: '["prod-.*", "staging-.*"]'

include: '["app-.*", "service-.*"]'
```

=== `consumer_groups.exclude`

Regular expressions for consumer groups to exclude from offset migration. Takes precedence over include patterns. Useful for excluding system or temporary groups.


*Type*: `array`


```yml
# Examples

exclude: '[".*-test", ".*-temp", "connect-.*"]'

exclude: '["dev-.*", "local-.*"]'
```

=== `consumer_groups.only_empty`

Whether to only migrate Empty consumer groups. When false (default), all statuses except Dead are included; when true, only Empty groups are migrated.


*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `false`

=== `topic`

The topic to write messages to. Use interpolation to derive destination topic names from source topics. The source topic name is available as 'kafka_topic' metadata.
This field supports xref:configuration:interpolation.adoc#bloblang-queries[interpolation functions].


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `"${! @kafka_topic }"`

```yml
# Examples

topic: prod_${! @kafka_topic }
```

=== `topic_replication_factor`

The replication factor for created topics. If not specified, inherits the replication factor from source topics. Useful when migrating to clusters with different sizes.


*Type*: `int`


```yml
# Examples

topic_replication_factor: "3"

topic_replication_factor: '1  # For single-node clusters'
```

=== `sync_topic_acls`

Whether to synchronise topic ACLs from source to destination cluster. ACLs are transformed safely: ALLOW WRITE permissions are excluded, and ALLOW ALL is downgraded to ALLOW READ to prevent conflicts.


*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `false`

=== `serverless`

Enable serverless mode for Redpanda Cloud serverless clusters. This restricts topic configurations and schema features to those supported by serverless environments.


*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `false`
