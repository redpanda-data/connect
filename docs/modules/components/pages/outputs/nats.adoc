This output will interpolate functions within the subject field, you can find a list of functions xref:configuration:interpolation.adoc#bloblang-queries[here].

== Connection name

When monitoring and managing a production NATS system, it is often useful to
know which connection a message was send/received from. This can be achieved by
setting the connection name option when creating a NATS connection.

Redpanda Connect will automatically set the connection name based off the label of the given
NATS component, so that monitoring tools between NATS and Redpanda Connect can stay in sync.


== Authentication

There are several components within Redpanda Connect which uses NATS services. You will find that each of these components
support optional advanced authentication parameters for https://docs.nats.io/nats-server/configuration/securing_nats/auth_intro/nkey_auth[NKeys^]
and https://docs.nats.io/using-nats/developer/connecting/creds[User Credentials^].

See an https://docs.nats.io/running-a-nats-service/nats_admin/security/jwt[in-depth tutorial^].

=== NKey file

The NATS server can use these NKeys in several ways for authentication. The simplest is for the server to be configured
with a list of known public keys and for the clients to respond to the challenge by signing it with its private NKey
configured in the `nkey_file` field.

https://docs.nats.io/running-a-nats-service/configuration/securing_nats/auth_intro/nkey_auth[More details^].

=== User credentials

NATS server supports decentralized authentication based on JSON Web Tokens (JWT). Clients need an https://docs.nats.io/nats-server/configuration/securing_nats/jwt#json-web-tokens[user JWT^]
and a corresponding https://docs.nats.io/running-a-nats-service/configuration/securing_nats/auth_intro/nkey_auth[NKey secret^] when connecting to a server
which is configured to use this authentication scheme.

The `user_credentials_file` field should point to a file containing both the private key and the JWT and can be
generated with the https://docs.nats.io/nats-tools/nsc[nsc tool^].

Alternatively, the `user_jwt` field can contain a plain text JWT and the `user_nkey_seed`can contain
the plain text NKey Seed.

https://docs.nats.io/using-nats/developer/connecting/creds[More details^].

== Fields

*Default*: `{}`

```yml
# Examples

headers:
  Content-Type: application/json
  Timestamp: ${!meta("Timestamp")}
```

=== `metadata`

Determine which (if any) metadata values should be added to messages as headers.


*Type*: `object`


=== `metadata.include_prefixes`

Provide a list of explicit metadata key prefixes to match against.


*Type*: `array`

*Default*: `[]`

```yml
# Examples

include_prefixes:
  - foo_
  - bar_

include_prefixes:
  - kafka_

include_prefixes:
  - content-
```

=== `metadata.include_patterns`

Provide a list of explicit metadata key regular expression (re2) patterns to match against.


*Type*: `array`

*Default*: `[]`

```yml
# Examples

include_patterns:
  - .*

include_patterns:
  - _timestamp_unix$
```

=== `max_in_flight`

The maximum number of messages to have in flight at a given time. Increase this to improve throughput.


*Type*: `int`

*Default*: `64`

=== `tls`

Custom TLS settings can be used to override system defaults.


*Type*: `object`


=== `tls.enabled`

Whether custom TLS settings are enabled.


*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `false`

=== `tls.skip_cert_verify`

Whether to skip server side certificate verification.


*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `false`

=== `tls.enable_renegotiation`

Whether to allow the remote server to repeatedly request renegotiation. Enable this option if you're seeing the error message `local error: tls: no renegotiation`.


*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `false`
Requires version 3.45.0 or newer

=== `tls.root_cas`

An optional root certificate authority to use. This is a string, representing a certificate chain from the parent trusted root certificate, to possible intermediate signing certificates, to the host certificate.
[CAUTION]
====
This field contains sensitive information that usually shouldn't be added to a config directly, read our xref:configuration:secrets.adoc[secrets page for more info].
====



*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

```yml
# Examples

root_cas: |-
  -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
  ...
  -----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

=== `tls.root_cas_file`

An optional path of a root certificate authority file to use. This is a file, often with a .pem extension, containing a certificate chain from the parent trusted root certificate, to possible intermediate signing certificates, to the host certificate.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

```yml
# Examples

root_cas_file: ./root_cas.pem
```

=== `tls.client_certs`

A list of client certificates to use. For each certificate either the fields `cert` and `key`, or `cert_file` and `key_file` should be specified, but not both.


*Type*: `array`

*Default*: `[]`

```yml
# Examples

client_certs:
  - cert: foo
    key: bar

client_certs:
  - cert_file: ./example.pem
    key_file: ./example.key
```

=== `tls.client_certs[].cert`

A plain text certificate to use.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `tls.client_certs[].key`

A plain text certificate key to use.
[CAUTION]
====
This field contains sensitive information that usually shouldn't be added to a config directly, read our xref:configuration:secrets.adoc[secrets page for more info].
====



*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `tls.client_certs[].cert_file`

The path of a certificate to use.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `tls.client_certs[].key_file`

The path of a certificate key to use.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `tls.client_certs[].password`

A plain text password for when the private key is password encrypted in PKCS#1 or PKCS#8 format. The obsolete `pbeWithMD5AndDES-CBC` algorithm is not supported for the PKCS#8 format.

Because the obsolete pbeWithMD5AndDES-CBC algorithm does not authenticate the ciphertext, it is vulnerable to padding oracle attacks that can let an attacker recover the plaintext.
[CAUTION]
