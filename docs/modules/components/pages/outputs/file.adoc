Writes messages to files on disk based on a chosen codec.

```yml
# Config fields, showing default values
output:
  label: ""
  file:
    path: /tmp/data.txt # No default (required)
    codec: lines
```

Messages can be written to different files by using xref:configuration:interpolation.adoc#bloblang-queries[interpolation functions] in the path field. However, only one file is ever open at a given time, and therefore when the path changes the previously open file is closed.

== Fields

=== `path`

The file to write to, if the file does not yet exist it will be created.
This field supports xref:configuration:interpolation.adoc#bloblang-queries[interpolation functions].


*Type*: `string`

Requires version 3.33.0 or newer

```yml
# Examples

path: /tmp/data.txt

path: /tmp/${! timestamp_unix() }.txt

path: /tmp/${! json("document.id") }.json
```

=== `codec`

The way in which the bytes of messages should be written out into the output data stream. It's possible to write lines using a custom delimiter with the `delim:x` codec, where x is the character sequence custom delimiter.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `"lines"`
Requires version 3.33.0 or newer

|===
| Option | Summary

| `all-bytes`
| Only applicable to file based outputs. Writes each message to a file in full, if the file already exists the old content is deleted.
| `append`
| Append each message to the output stream without any delimiter or special encoding.
| `lines`
| Append each message to the output stream followed by a line break.
| `delim:x`
| Append each message to the output stream followed by a custom delimiter.

|===

```yml
# Examples

codec: lines

codec: "delim:\t"

codec: delim:foobar
```
