== Metadata

Message metadata is added to each AMQP message as string annotations. In order to control which metadata keys are added use the `metadata` config field.

== Performance

This output benefits from sending multiple messages in flight in parallel for improved performance. You can tune the max number of in flight messages (or message batches) with the field `max_in_flight`.

== Fields

=== `urls`

A list of URLs to connect to. The first URL to successfully establish a connection will be used until the connection is closed. If an item of the list contains commas it will be expanded into multiple URLs.


*Type*: `array`

Requires version 4.23.0 or newer

```yml
# Examples

urls:
  - amqp://guest:guest@127.0.0.1:5672/

urls:
  - amqp://127.0.0.1:5672/,amqp://127.0.0.2:5672/

urls:
  - amqp://127.0.0.1:5672/
  - amqp://127.0.0.2:5672/
```

=== `target_address`

The target address to write to.


*Type*: `string`


```yml
# Examples

target_address: /foo

target_address: queue:/bar

target_address: topic:/baz
```

=== `max_in_flight`

The maximum number of messages to have in flight at a given time. Increase this to improve throughput.


*Type*: `int`

*Default*: `64`

=== `tls`

Custom TLS settings can be used to override system defaults.


*Type*: `object`


=== `tls.enabled`

Whether custom TLS settings are enabled.


*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `false`

=== `tls.skip_cert_verify`

Whether to skip server side certificate verification.


*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `false`

=== `tls.enable_renegotiation`

Whether to allow the remote server to repeatedly request renegotiation. Enable this option if you're seeing the error message `local error: tls: no renegotiation`.


*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `false`
Requires version 3.45.0 or newer

=== `tls.root_cas`

An optional root certificate authority to use. This is a string, representing a certificate chain from the parent trusted root certificate, to possible intermediate signing certificates, to the host certificate.
[CAUTION]
====
This field contains sensitive information that usually shouldn't be added to a config directly, read our xref:configuration:secrets.adoc[secrets page for more info].
====



*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

```yml
# Examples

root_cas: |-
  -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
  ...
  -----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

=== `tls.root_cas_file`

An optional path of a root certificate authority file to use. This is a file, often with a .pem extension, containing a certificate chain from the parent trusted root certificate, to possible intermediate signing certificates, to the host certificate.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

```yml
# Examples

root_cas_file: ./root_cas.pem
```

=== `tls.client_certs`

A list of client certificates to use. For each certificate either the fields `cert` and `key`, or `cert_file` and `key_file` should be specified, but not both.


*Type*: `array`

*Default*: `[]`

```yml
# Examples

client_certs:
  - cert: foo
    key: bar

client_certs:
  - cert_file: ./example.pem
    key_file: ./example.key
```

=== `tls.client_certs[].cert`

A plain text certificate to use.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `tls.client_certs[].key`

A plain text certificate key to use.
[CAUTION]
====
This field contains sensitive information that usually shouldn't be added to a config directly, read our xref:configuration:secrets.adoc[secrets page for more info].
====



*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `tls.client_certs[].cert_file`

The path of a certificate to use.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `tls.client_certs[].key_file`

The path of a certificate key to use.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `tls.client_certs[].password`

A plain text password for when the private key is password encrypted in PKCS#1 or PKCS#8 format. The obsolete `pbeWithMD5AndDES-CBC` algorithm is not supported for the PKCS#8 format.

Because the obsolete pbeWithMD5AndDES-CBC algorithm does not authenticate the ciphertext, it is vulnerable to padding oracle attacks that can let an attacker recover the plaintext.

[WARNING]

====



*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

```yml
# Examples

password: foo

password: ${KEY_PASSWORD}
```

=== `application_properties_map`

An optional Bloblang mapping that can be defined in order to set the `application-properties` on output messages.


*Type*: `string`


=== `sasl`

Enables SASL authentication.


*Type*: `object`


=== `sasl.mechanism`

The SASL authentication mechanism to use.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `"none"`

|===
| Option | Summary

| `anonymous`
| Anonymous SASL authentication.
| `none`
| No SASL based authentication.
| `plain`
| Plain text SASL authentication.

|===

=== `sasl.user`

A SASL plain text username. It is recommended that you use environment variables to populate this field.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

# Examples

user: ${USER}
```

=== `sasl.password`

A SASL plain text password. It is recommended that you use environment variables to populate this field.

password: ${PASSWORD}
```

=== `metadata`

Specify criteria for which metadata values are attached to messages as headers.


*Type*: `object`


=== `metadata.exclude_prefixes`

Provide a list of explicit metadata key prefixes to be excluded when adding metadata to sent messages.


*Type*: `array`

*Default*: `[]`
