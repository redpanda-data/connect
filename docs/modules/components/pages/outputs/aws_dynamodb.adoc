The field `string_columns` is a map of column names to string values, where the values are xref:configuration:interpolation.adoc#bloblang-queries[function interpolated] per message of a batch. This allows you to populate string columns of an item by extracting fields within the document payload or metadata like follows:

```yml
string_columns:
  id: ${!json("id")}
  title: ${!json("body.title")}
  topic: ${!meta("kafka_topic")}
  full_content: ${!content()}
```

The field `json_map_columns` is a map of column names to json paths, where the xref:configuration:field_paths.adoc[dot path] is extracted from each document and converted into a map value. Both an empty path and the path `.` are interpreted as the root of the document. This allows you to populate map columns of an item like follows:

```yml
json_map_columns:
  user: path.to.user
  whole_document: .
```

A column name can be empty:

```yml
json_map_columns:
  "": .
```

In which case the top level document fields will be written at the root of the item, potentially overwriting previously defined column values. If a path is not found within a document the column will not be populated.

== Credentials

By default Redpanda Connect will use a shared credentials file when connecting to AWS services. It's also possible to set them explicitly at the component level, allowing you to transfer data across accounts. You can find out more in xref:guides:cloud/aws.adoc[].

== Performance

This output benefits from sending multiple messages in flight in parallel for improved performance. You can tune the max number of in flight messages (or message batches) with the field `max_in_flight`.

This output benefits from sending messages as a batch for improved performance. Batches can be formed at both the input and output level. You can find out more xref:configuration:batching.adoc[in this doc].


== Fields

=== `table`

The table to store messages in.


*Type*: `string`


=== `string_columns`

A map of column keys to string values to store.
This field supports xref:configuration:interpolation.adoc#bloblang-queries[interpolation functions].


*Type*: `object`

*Default*: `{}`

```yml
# Examples

string_columns:
  full_content: ${!content()}
  id: ${!json("id")}
  title: ${!json("body.title")}
  topic: ${!meta("kafka_topic")}
```

=== `json_map_columns`

A map of column keys to xref:configuration:field_paths.adoc[field paths] pointing to value data within messages.


*Type*: `object`

*Default*: `{}`

```yml
# Examples

json_map_columns:
  user: path.to.user
  whole_document: .

json_map_columns:
  "": .
```

=== `ttl`

An optional TTL to set for items, calculated from the moment the message is sent.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `ttl_key`

The column key to place the TTL value within.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `max_in_flight`

The maximum number of messages to have in flight at a given time. Increase this to improve throughput.


*Type*: `int`

*Default*: `64`

=== `batching`

Allows you to configure a xref:configuration:batching.adoc[batching policy].


*Type*: `object`


```yml
# Examples

batching:
  byte_size: 5000
  count: 0
  period: 1s

batching:
  count: 10
  period: 1s

batching:
  check: this.contains("END BATCH")
  count: 0
  period: 1m
```

=== `batching.count`

A number of messages at which the batch should be flushed. If `0` disables count based batching.


*Type*: `int`

*Default*: `0`

=== `batching.byte_size`

An amount of bytes at which the batch should be flushed. If `0` disables size based batching.


*Type*: `int`

*Default*: `0`

=== `batching.period`

A period in which an incomplete batch should be flushed regardless of its size.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

```yml
# Examples

period: 1s

period: 1m

period: 500ms
```

=== `batching.check`

A xref:guides:bloblang/about.adoc[Bloblang query] that should return a boolean value indicating whether a message should end a batch.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

```yml
# Examples

check: this.type == "end_of_transaction"
```

=== `batching.processors`

A list of xref:components:processors/about.adoc[processors] to apply to a batch as it is flushed. This allows you to aggregate and archive the batch however you see fit. Please note that all resulting messages are flushed as a single batch, therefore splitting the batch into smaller batches using these processors is a no-op.


*Type*: `array`


```yml
# Examples

processors:
  - archive:
      format: concatenate

processors:
  - archive:
      format: lines

processors:
  - archive:
      format: json_array
```

=== `region`

The AWS region to target.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `endpoint`

Allows you to specify a custom endpoint for the AWS API.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `credentials`

Optional manual configuration of AWS credentials to use. More information can be found in xref:guides:cloud/aws.adoc[].


*Type*: `object`


=== `credentials.profile`

A profile from `~/.aws/credentials` to use.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `credentials.id`

The ID of credentials to use.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `credentials.secret`

The secret for the credentials being used.
[CAUTION]
====
This field contains sensitive information that usually shouldn't be added to a config directly, read our xref:configuration:secrets.adoc[secrets page for more info].
====



*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `credentials.token`

The token for the credentials being used, required when using short term credentials.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `credentials.from_ec2_role`

Use the credentials of a host EC2 machine configured to assume https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_switch-role-ec2.html[an IAM role associated with the instance^].


*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `false`
Requires version 4.2.0 or newer

=== `credentials.role`

A role ARN to assume.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `credentials.role_external_id`

An external ID to provide when assuming a role.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `max_retries`

The maximum number of retries before giving up on the request. If set to zero there is no discrete limit.


*Type*: `int`

*Default*: `3`

=== `backoff`

Control time intervals between retry attempts.


*Type*: `object`


=== `backoff.initial_interval`

The initial period to wait between retry attempts.


*Type*: `string`

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `"5s"`

=== `backoff.max_elapsed_time`

The maximum period to wait before retry attempts are abandoned. If zero then no limit is used.
