Stores key/value pairs in a lru in-memory cache. This cache is therefore reset every time the service restarts.

This provides the lru package which implements a fixed-size thread safe LRU cache.

It uses the package https://github.com/hashicorp/golang-lru/v2[`lru`^]

The field init_values can be used to pre-populate the memory cache with any number of key/value pairs:

```yaml
cache_resources:
  - label: foocache
    lru:
      cap: 1024
      init_values:
        foo: bar
```

These values can be overridden during execution.

== Fields

=== `cap`

The cache maximum capacity (number of entries)


*Type*: `int`

*Default*: `1000`

=== `init_values`

A table of key/value pairs that should be present in the cache on initialization. This can be used to create static lookup tables.


*Type*: `object`

*Default*: `{}`

```yml
# Examples

init_values:
  Nickelback: "1995"
  Spice Girls: "1994"
  The Human League: "1977"
```

=== `algorithm`

the lru cache implementation


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `"standard"`

|===
| Option | Summary

| `arc`
| is an adaptive replacement cache. It tracks recent evictions as well as recent usage in both the frequent and recent caches. Its computational overhead is comparable to two_queues, but the memory overhead is linear with the size of the cache. ARC has been patented by IBM.
| `standard`
| is a simple LRU cache. It is based on the LRU implementation in groupcache
| `two_queues`
| tracks frequently used and recently used entries separately. This avoids a burst of accesses from taking out frequently used entries, at the cost of about 2x computational overhead and some extra bookkeeping.

|===

=== `two_queues_recent_ratio`

is the ratio of the two_queues cache dedicated to recently added entries that have only been accessed once.


*Type*: `float`

*Default*: `0.25`

=== `two_queues_ghost_ratio`

is the default ratio of ghost entries kept to track entries recently evicted on two_queues cache.


*Type*: `float`

*Default*: `0.5`

=== `optimistic`

If true, we do not lock on read/write events. The lru package is thread-safe, however the ADD operation is not atomic.


*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `false`
