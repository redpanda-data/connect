== KV operations

The NATS KV processor supports a multitude of KV operations via the <<operation>> field. Along with `get`, `put`, and `delete`, this processor supports atomic operations like `update` and `create`, as well as utility operations like `purge`, `history`, and `keys`.

== Metadata

This processor adds the following metadata fields to each message, depending on the chosen `operation`:

=== get, get_revision
``` text
- nats_kv_key
- nats_kv_bucket
- nats_kv_revision
- nats_kv_delta
- nats_kv_operation
- nats_kv_created
```

=== create, update, delete, purge
``` text
- nats_kv_key
- nats_kv_bucket
- nats_kv_revision
- nats_kv_operation
```

=== keys
``` text
- nats_kv_bucket
```

== Connection name

When monitoring and managing a production NATS system, it is often useful to
know which connection a message was send/received from. This can be achieved by
setting the connection name option when creating a NATS connection.

Redpanda Connect will automatically set the connection name based off the label of the given
NATS component, so that monitoring tools between NATS and Redpanda Connect can stay in sync.


== Authentication

There are several components within Redpanda Connect which uses NATS services. You will find that each of these components
support optional advanced authentication parameters for https://docs.nats.io/nats-server/configuration/securing_nats/auth_intro/nkey_auth[NKeys^]
and https://docs.nats.io/using-nats/developer/connecting/creds[User Credentials^].

See an https://docs.nats.io/running-a-nats-service/nats_admin/security/jwt[in-depth tutorial^].

=== NKey file

The NATS server can use these NKeys in several ways for authentication. The simplest is for the server to be configured
with a list of known public keys and for the clients to respond to the challenge by signing it with its private NKey
configured in the `nkey_file` or `nkey` field.

https://docs.nats.io/running-a-nats-service/configuration/securing_nats/auth_intro/nkey_auth[More details^].

=== User credentials

NATS server supports decentralized authentication based on JSON Web Tokens (JWT). Clients need an https://docs.nats.io/nats-server/configuration/securing_nats/jwt#json-web-tokens[user JWT^]
and a corresponding https://docs.nats.io/running-a-nats-service/configuration/securing_nats/auth_intro/nkey_auth[NKey secret^] when connecting to a server
which is configured to use this authentication scheme.

The `user_credentials_file` field should point to a file containing both the private key and the JWT and can be
generated with the https://docs.nats.io/nats-tools/nsc[nsc tool^].

Alternatively, the `user_jwt` field can contain a plain text JWT and the `user_nkey_seed`can contain
the plain text NKey Seed.

https://docs.nats.io/using-nats/developer/connecting/creds[More details^].

== Fields

=== `urls`

A list of URLs to connect to. If an item of the list contains commas it will be expanded into multiple URLs.


*Type*: `array`


```yml
# Examples

urls:
  - nats://127.0.0.1:4222

urls:
  - nats://username:password@127.0.0.1:4222
```

=== `max_reconnects`

The maximum number of times to attempt to reconnect to the server. If negative, it will never stop trying to reconnect.


*Type*: `int`


=== `bucket`

The name of the KV bucket.


*Type*: `string`


```yml
# Examples

bucket: my_kv_bucket
```

=== `operation`

The operation to perform on the KV bucket.


*Type*: `string`


|===
| Option | Summary

| `create`
| Adds the key/value pair if it does not exist. Returns an error if it already exists.
| `delete`
| Deletes the key/value pair, but keeps historical values.
| `get`
| Returns the latest value for `key`.
| `get_revision`
| Returns the value of `key` for the specified `revision`.
| `history`
| Returns historical values of `key` as an array of objects containing the following fields: `key`, `value`, `bucket`, `revision`, `delta`, `operation`, `created`.
| `keys`
| Returns the keys in the `bucket` which match the `keys_filter` as an array of strings.
| `purge`
| Deletes the key/value pair and all historical values.
| `put`
| Places a new value for the key into the store.
| `update`
| Updates the value for `key` only if the `revision` matches the latest revision.

|===

=== `key`

The key for each message. Supports https://docs.nats.io/nats-concepts/subjects#wildcards[wildcards^] for the `history` and `keys` operations.
This field supports xref:configuration:interpolation.adoc#bloblang-queries[interpolation functions].


*Type*: `string`


```yml
# Examples

key: foo

key: foo.bar.baz

key: foo.*

key: foo.>

key: foo.${! json("meta.type") }
```

=== `revision`

The revision of the key to operate on. Used for `get_revision` and `update` operations.
This field supports xref:configuration:interpolation.adoc#bloblang-queries[interpolation functions].


*Type*: `string`


```yml
# Examples

revision: "42"

revision: ${! @nats_kv_revision }
```

=== `timeout`

The maximum period to wait on an operation before aborting and returning an error.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `"5s"`

=== `tls`

Custom TLS settings can be used to override system defaults.


*Type*: `object`


=== `tls.enabled`

Whether custom TLS settings are enabled.


*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `false`

=== `tls.skip_cert_verify`

Whether to skip server side certificate verification.


*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `false`

=== `tls.enable_renegotiation`

Whether to allow the remote server to repeatedly request renegotiation. Enable this option if you're seeing the error message `local error: tls: no renegotiation`.


*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `false`
Requires version 3.45.0 or newer

=== `tls.root_cas`

An optional root certificate authority to use. This is a string, representing a certificate chain from the parent trusted root certificate, to possible intermediate signing certificates, to the host certificate.
[CAUTION]
====
This field contains sensitive information that usually shouldn't be added to a config directly, read our xref:configuration:secrets.adoc[secrets page for more info].
====



*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

```yml
# Examples

root_cas: |-
  -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
  ...
  -----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

=== `tls.root_cas_file`

An optional path of a root certificate authority file to use. This is a file, often with a .pem extension, containing a certificate chain from the parent trusted root certificate, to possible intermediate signing certificates, to the host certificate.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

```yml
# Examples

root_cas_file: ./root_cas.pem
```

=== `tls.client_certs`

A list of client certificates to use. For each certificate either the fields `cert` and `key`, or `cert_file` and `key_file` should be specified, but not both.


*Type*: `array`

*Default*: `[]`

```yml
# Examples

client_certs:
  - cert: foo
    key: bar

client_certs:
  - cert_file: ./example.pem
    key_file: ./example.key
```

=== `tls.client_certs[].cert`

A plain text certificate to use.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `tls.client_certs[].key`

A plain text certificate key to use.
[CAUTION]
====
This field contains sensitive information that usually shouldn't be added to a config directly, read our xref:configuration:secrets.adoc[secrets page for more info].
====



*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `tls.client_certs[].cert_file`

The path of a certificate to use.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `tls.client_certs[].key_file`

The path of a certificate key to use.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `tls.client_certs[].password`

A plain text password for when the private key is password encrypted in PKCS#1 or PKCS#8 format. The obsolete `pbeWithMD5AndDES-CBC` algorithm is not supported for the PKCS#8 format.

Because the obsolete pbeWithMD5AndDES-CBC algorithm does not authenticate the ciphertext, it is vulnerable to padding oracle attacks that can let an attacker recover the plaintext.
[CAUTION]
