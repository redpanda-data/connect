Generates vector embeddings to represent input text, using the Cohere API.

Introduced in version 4.37.0.

```yml
# Config fields, showing default values
label: ""
cohere_rerank:
  base_url: https://api.cohere.com
  api_key: "" # No default (required)
  model: rerank-v3.5 # No default (required)
  query: "" # No default (required)
  documents: "" # No default (required)
  top_n: 0
  max_tokens_per_doc: 4096
```

This processor sends document strings to the Cohere API, which reranks them based on the relevance to the query.

To learn more about reranking, see the https://docs.cohere.com/docs/rerank-2[Cohere API documentation^].

The output of this processor is an array of objects, each containing a "document" field with the original document content and a "relevance_score" field indicating how relevant it is to the query. The objects are ordered by their relevance score (highest first).
