Listens to a https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/changefeed-examples[CockroachDB Core Changefeed^] and creates a message for each row received. Each message is a json object looking like: 
```json
{
	"primary_key": "[\"1a7ff641-3e3b-47ee-94fe-a0cadb56cd8f\", 2]", // stringifed JSON array
	"row": "{\"after\": {\"k\": \"1a7ff641-3e3b-47ee-94fe-a0cadb56cd8f\", \"v\": 2}, \"updated\": \"1637953249519902405.0000000000\"}", // stringified JSON object
	"table": "strm_2"
}
```

This input will continue to listen to the changefeed until shutdown. A backfill of the full current state of the table will be delivered upon each run unless a cache is configured for storing cursor timestamps, as this is how Redpanda Connect keeps track as to which changes have been successfully delivered.

Note: You must have `SET CLUSTER SETTING kv.rangefeed.enabled = true;` on your CRDB cluster, for more information refer to https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/changefeed-examples?filters=core[the official CockroachDB documentation^].

== Fields

=== `dsn`

A Data Source Name to identify the target database.


*Type*: `string`


```yml
# Examples

dsn: postgres://user:password@example.com:26257/defaultdb?sslmode=require
```

=== `tls`

Custom TLS settings can be used to override system defaults.


*Type*: `object`


=== `tls.skip_cert_verify`

Whether to skip server side certificate verification.


*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `false`

=== `tls.enable_renegotiation`

Whether to allow the remote server to repeatedly request renegotiation. Enable this option if you're seeing the error message `local error: tls: no renegotiation`.


*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `false`
Requires version 3.45.0 or newer

=== `tls.root_cas`

An optional root certificate authority to use. This is a string, representing a certificate chain from the parent trusted root certificate, to possible intermediate signing certificates, to the host certificate.
[CAUTION]
====
This field contains sensitive information that usually shouldn't be added to a config directly, read our xref:configuration:secrets.adoc[secrets page for more info].
====



*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

```yml
# Examples

root_cas: |-
  -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
  ...
  -----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

=== `tls.root_cas_file`

An optional path of a root certificate authority file to use. This is a file, often with a .pem extension, containing a certificate chain from the parent trusted root certificate, to possible intermediate signing certificates, to the host certificate.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

```yml
# Examples

root_cas_file: ./root_cas.pem
```

=== `tls.client_certs`

A list of client certificates to use. For each certificate either the fields `cert` and `key`, or `cert_file` and `key_file` should be specified, but not both.


*Type*: `array`

*Default*: `[]`

```yml
# Examples

client_certs:
  - cert: foo
    key: bar

client_certs:
  - cert_file: ./example.pem
    key_file: ./example.key
```

=== `tls.client_certs[].cert`

A plain text certificate to use.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `tls.client_certs[].key`

A plain text certificate key to use.
[CAUTION]
====
This field contains sensitive information that usually shouldn't be added to a config directly, read our xref:configuration:secrets.adoc[secrets page for more info].
====



*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `tls.client_certs[].cert_file`

The path of a certificate to use.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `tls.client_certs[].key_file`

The path of a certificate key to use.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `tls.client_certs[].password`

A plain text password for when the private key is password encrypted in PKCS#1 or PKCS#8 format. The obsolete `pbeWithMD5AndDES-CBC` algorithm is not supported for the PKCS#8 format.

Because the obsolete pbeWithMD5AndDES-CBC algorithm does not authenticate the ciphertext, it is vulnerable to padding oracle attacks that can let an attacker recover the plaintext.
[CAUTION]
====
This field contains sensitive information that usually shouldn't be added to a config directly, read our xref:configuration:secrets.adoc[secrets page for more info].
====



*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

```yml
# Examples

password: foo

password: ${KEY_PASSWORD}
```

=== `tables`

CSV of tables to be included in the changefeed


*Type*: `array`


```yml
# Examples

tables:
  - table1
  - table2
```

=== `cursor_cache`

A https://www.docs.redpanda.com/redpanda-connect/components/caches/about[cache resource^] to use for storing the current latest cursor that has been successfully delivered, this allows Redpanda Connect to continue from that cursor upon restart, rather than consume the entire state of the table.


*Type*: `string`


=== `options`

A list of options to be included in the changefeed (WITH X, Y...).

NOTE: Both the CURSOR option and UPDATED will be ignored from these options when a `cursor_cache` is specified, as they are set explicitly by Redpanda Connect in this case.


*Type*: `array`


```yml
# Examples

options:
  - virtual_columns="omitted"
```

=== `auto_replay_nacks`

Whether messages that are rejected (nacked) at the output level should be automatically replayed indefinitely, eventually resulting in back pressure if the cause of the rejections is persistent. If set to `false` these messages will instead be deleted. Disabling auto replays can greatly improve memory efficiency of high throughput streams as the original shape of the data can be discarded immediately upon consumption and mutation.


*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `true`
