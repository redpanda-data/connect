This input adds the following metadata fields to each message:

```
- queue_storage_insertion_time
- queue_storage_queue_name
- queue_storage_message_lag (if 'track_properties' set to true)
- All user defined queue metadata
```

Only one authentication method is required, `storage_connection_string` or `storage_account` and `storage_access_key`. If both are set then the `storage_connection_string` is given priority.

== Fields

=== `storage_account`

The storage account to access. This field is ignored if `storage_connection_string` is set.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `storage_access_key`

The storage account access key. This field is ignored if `storage_connection_string` is set.
[CAUTION]
====
This field contains sensitive information that usually shouldn't be added to a config directly, read our xref:configuration:secrets.adoc[secrets page for more info].
====



*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `storage_connection_string`

A storage account connection string. This field is required if `storage_account` and `storage_access_key` / `storage_sas_token` are not set.
[CAUTION]
====
This field contains sensitive information that usually shouldn't be added to a config directly, read our xref:configuration:secrets.adoc[secrets page for more info].
====



*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `queue_name`

The name of the source storage queue.
This field supports xref:configuration:interpolation.adoc#bloblang-queries[interpolation functions].


*Type*: `string`


```yml
# Examples

queue_name: foo_queue

queue_name: ${! env("MESSAGE_TYPE").lowercase() }
```

=== `dequeue_visibility_timeout`

The timeout duration until a dequeued message gets visible again, 30s by default


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `"30s"`
Requires version 3.45.0 or newer

=== `max_in_flight`

The maximum number of unprocessed messages to fetch at a given time.


*Type*: `int`

*Default*: `10`

=== `track_properties`

If set to `true` the queue is polled on each read request for information such as the queue message lag. These properties are added to consumed messages as metadata, but will also have a negative performance impact.


*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `false`
