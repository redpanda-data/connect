The SpiceDB input allows you to consume messages from the Watch API of a SpiceDB instance.
This input is useful for applications that need to react to changes in the data managed by SpiceDB in real-time.

== Credentials

You need to provide the endpoint of your SpiceDB instance and a Bearer token for authentication.

== Cache

The zed token of the newest update consumed and acked is stored in a cache in order to start reading from it each time the input is initialised.
Ideally this cache should be persisted across restarts.


== Fields

=== `endpoint`

The SpiceDB endpoint.


*Type*: `string`


```yml
# Examples

endpoint: grpc.authzed.com:443
```

=== `bearer_token`

The SpiceDB Bearer token used to authenticate against the SpiceDB instance.

====



*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

```yml
# Examples

bearer_token: t_your_token_here_1234567deadbeef
```

=== `max_receive_message_bytes`

Maximum message size in bytes the SpiceDB client can receive.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `"4MB"`

```yml
# Examples

max_receive_message_bytes: 100MB

max_receive_message_bytes: 50mib
```

=== `cache`

A cache resource to use for performing unread message backfills, the ID of the last message received will be stored in this cache and used for subsequent requests.


*Type*: `string`


=== `cache_key`

The key identifier used when storing the ID of the last message received.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `"authzed.com/spicedb/watch/last_zed_token"`

=== `tls`

Custom TLS settings can be used to override system defaults.


*Type*: `object`


=== `tls.enabled`

Whether custom TLS settings are enabled.


*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `false`

=== `tls.skip_cert_verify`

Whether to skip server side certificate verification.


*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `false`

=== `tls.enable_renegotiation`

Whether to allow the remote server to repeatedly request renegotiation. Enable this option if you're seeing the error message `local error: tls: no renegotiation`.


*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `false`
Requires version 3.45.0 or newer

=== `tls.root_cas`

An optional root certificate authority to use. This is a string, representing a certificate chain from the parent trusted root certificate, to possible intermediate signing certificates, to the host certificate.
[CAUTION]

====



*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

```yml
# Examples

root_cas: |-
  -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
  ...
  -----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

=== `tls.root_cas_file`

An optional path of a root certificate authority file to use. This is a file, often with a .pem extension, containing a certificate chain from the parent trusted root certificate, to possible intermediate signing certificates, to the host certificate.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

```yml
# Examples

root_cas_file: ./root_cas.pem
```

=== `tls.client_certs`

A list of client certificates to use. For each certificate either the fields `cert` and `key`, or `cert_file` and `key_file` should be specified, but not both.


*Type*: `array`

*Default*: `[]`

```yml
# Examples

client_certs:
  - cert: foo
    key: bar

client_certs:
  - cert_file: ./example.pem
    key_file: ./example.key
```

=== `tls.client_certs[].cert`

A plain text certificate to use.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `tls.client_certs[].key`

A plain text certificate key to use.
[CAUTION]
====
This field contains sensitive information that usually shouldn't be added to a config directly, read our xref:configuration:secrets.adoc[secrets page for more info].
====



*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `tls.client_certs[].cert_file`

The path of a certificate to use.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `tls.client_certs[].key_file`

The path of a certificate key to use.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `tls.client_certs[].password`

A plain text password for when the private key is password encrypted in PKCS#1 or PKCS#8 format. The obsolete `pbeWithMD5AndDES-CBC` algorithm is not supported for the PKCS#8 format.

Because the obsolete pbeWithMD5AndDES-CBC algorithm does not authenticate the ciphertext, it is vulnerable to padding oracle attacks that can let an attacker recover the plaintext.
