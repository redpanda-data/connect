component_type_dropdown::[]


Executes a `SELECT` query against BigQuery and creates a message for each row received.

Introduced in version 3.63.0.

```yml
# Config fields, showing default values
input:
  label: ""
  gcp_bigquery_select:
    project: "" # No default (required)
    table: bigquery-public-data.samples.shakespeare # No default (required)
    columns: [] # No default (required)
    where: type = ? and created_at > ? # No default (optional)
    auto_replay_nacks: true
    job_labels: {}
    priority: ""
    args_mapping: root = [ "article", now().ts_format("2006-01-02") ] # No default (optional)
    prefix: "" # No default (optional)
    suffix: "" # No default (optional)
```

Once the rows from the query are exhausted, this input shuts down, allowing the pipeline to gracefully terminate (or the next input in a xref:components:inputs/sequence.adoc[sequence] to execute).

== Examples

[tabs]
======
Word counts::
+
--


Here we query the public corpus of Shakespeare's works to generate a stream of the top 10 words that are 3 or more characters long:

```yaml
input:
  gcp_bigquery_select:
    project: sample-project
    table: bigquery-public-data.samples.shakespeare
    columns:
      - word
      - sum(word_count) as total_count
    where: length(word) >= ?
    suffix: |
      GROUP BY word
      ORDER BY total_count DESC
      LIMIT 10
    args_mapping: |
      root = [ 3 ]
```

== Fields

=== `project`

GCP project where the query job will execute.


*Type*: `string`


=== `table`

Fully-qualified BigQuery table name to query.


*Type*: `string`


```yml
# Examples

table: bigquery-public-data.samples.shakespeare
```

=== `columns`

A list of columns to query.


*Type*: `array`


=== `where`

An optional where clause to add. Placeholder arguments are populated with the `args_mapping` field. Placeholders should always be question marks (`?`).


*Type*: `string`


```yml
# Examples

where: type = ? and created_at > ?

where: user_id = ?
```

=== `auto_replay_nacks`

Whether messages that are rejected (nacked) at the output level should be automatically replayed indefinitely, eventually resulting in back pressure if the cause of the rejections is persistent. If set to `false` these messages will instead be deleted. Disabling auto replays can greatly improve memory efficiency of high throughput streams as the original shape of the data can be discarded immediately upon consumption and mutation.


*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `true`

=== `job_labels`

A list of labels to add to the query job.


*Type*: `object`

*Default*: `{}`

=== `priority`

The priority with which to schedule the query.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `args_mapping`

An optional xref:guides:bloblang/about.adoc[Bloblang mapping] which should evaluate to an array of values matching in size to the number of placeholder arguments in the field `where`.


*Type*: `string`


```yml
# Examples

args_mapping: root = [ "article", now().ts_format("2006-01-02") ]
```

=== `prefix`

An optional prefix to prepend to the select query (before SELECT).


*Type*: `string`


=== `suffix`

An optional suffix to append to the select query.


*Type*: `string`
