A Git input that clones (or pulls) a repository and reads the repository contents.

Introduced in version 4.51.0.

```yml
# Config fields, showing default values
input:
  label: ""
  git:
    repository_url: https://github.com/username/repo.git # No default (required)
    branch: main
    poll_interval: 10s
    include_patterns: []
    exclude_patterns: []
    max_file_size: 10485760
    checkpoint_cache: "" # No default (optional)
    checkpoint_key: git_last_commit
    auth:
      basic:
        username: ""
        password: ""
      ssh_key:
        private_key_path: ""
        private_key: ""
        passphrase: ""
      token:
        value: ""
    auto_replay_nacks: true
```

The git input clones the specified repository (or pulls updates if already cloned) and reads 
the content of the specified file. It periodically polls the repository for new commits and emits 
a message when changes are detected.

== Metadata

This input adds the following metadata fields to each message:

- git_file_path
- git_file_size
- git_file_mode
- git_file_modified
- git_commit
- git_mime_type
- git_is_binary
- git_encoding (present if the file was base64 encoded)
- git_deleted (only present if the file was deleted)

You can access these metadata fields using function interpolation.

== Fields

=== `repository_url`

The URL of the Git repository to clone.


*Type*: `string`


```yml
# Examples

repository_url: https://github.com/username/repo.git
```

=== `branch`

The branch to check out.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `"main"`

=== `poll_interval`

Duration between polling attempts


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `"10s"`

```yml
# Examples

poll_interval: 10s
```

=== `include_patterns`

A list of file patterns to include (e.g., '**/*.md', 'configs/*.yaml'). If empty, all files will be included. Supports glob patterns: *, /**/, ?, and character ranges [a-z]. Any character with a special meaning can be escaped with a backslash.


*Type*: `array`

*Default*: `[]`

=== `exclude_patterns`

A list of file patterns to exclude (e.g., '.git/**', '**/*.png'). These patterns take precedence over include_patterns. Supports glob patterns: *, /**/, ?, and character ranges [a-z]. Any character with a special meaning can be escaped with a backslash.


*Type*: `array`

*Default*: `[]`

=== `max_file_size`

The maximum size of files to include in bytes. Files larger than this will be skipped. Set to 0 for no limit.


*Type*: `int`

*Default*: `10485760`

=== `checkpoint_cache`

A cache resource to store the last processed commit hash, allowing the input to resume from where it left off after a restart.


*Type*: `string`


=== `checkpoint_key`

The key to use when storing the last processed commit hash in the cache.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `"git_last_commit"`

=== `auth`

Authentication options for the Git repository


*Type*: `object`


=== `auth.basic`

Basic authentication credentials


*Type*: `object`


=== `auth.basic.username`

Username for basic authentication


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `auth.basic.password`

Password for basic authentication

=== `auth.ssh_key.private_key_path`

Path to SSH private key file


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `auth.ssh_key.private_key`

SSH private key content

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `auto_replay_nacks`

Whether messages that are rejected (nacked) at the output level should be automatically replayed indefinitely, eventually resulting in back pressure if the cause of the rejections is persistent. If set to `false` these messages will instead be deleted. Disabling auto replays can greatly improve memory efficiency of high throughput streams as the original shape of the data can be discarded immediately upon consumption and mutation.


*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `true`
