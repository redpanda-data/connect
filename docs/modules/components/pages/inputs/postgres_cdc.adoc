Using this field overrides the SSL/TLS settings in the environment and DSN.

== Fields

=== `dsn`

The Data Source Name for the PostgreSQL database in the form of `postgres://[user[:password]@][netloc][:port][/dbname][?param1=value1&...]`. Please note that Postgres enforces SSL by default, you can override this with the parameter `sslmode=disable` if required.


*Type*: `string`


```yml
# Examples

dsn: postgres://foouser:foopass@localhost:5432/foodb?sslmode=disable
```

=== `include_transaction_markers`

When set to true, empty messages with operation types BEGIN and COMMIT are generated for the beginning and end of each transaction. Messages with operation metadata set to "begin" or "commit" will have null message payloads.


*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `false`

=== `stream_snapshot`

When set to true, the plugin will first stream a snapshot of all existing data in the database before streaming changes. In order to use this the tables that are being snapshot MUST have a primary key set so that reading from the table can be parallelized.


*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `false`

```yml
# Examples

stream_snapshot: true
```

=== `snapshot_batch_size`

The number of rows to fetch in each batch when querying the snapshot.


*Type*: `int`

*Default*: `1000`

```yml
# Examples

snapshot_batch_size: 10000
```

=== `schema`

The PostgreSQL schema from which to replicate data.


*Type*: `string`


```yml
# Examples

schema: public

schema: '"MyCaseSensitiveSchemaNeedingQuotes"'
```

=== `tables`

A list of table names to include in the logical replication. Each table should be specified as a separate item.


*Type*: `array`


```yml
# Examples

tables:
  - my_table_1
  - '"MyCaseSensitiveTableNeedingQuotes"'
```

=== `checkpoint_limit`

The maximum number of messages that can be processed at a given time. Increasing this limit enables parallel processing and batching at the output level. Any given LSN will not be acknowledged unless all messages under that offset are delivered in order to preserve at least once delivery guarantees.


*Type*: `int`

*Default*: `1024`

=== `temporary_slot`

If set to true, creates a temporary replication slot that is automatically dropped when the connection is closed.


*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `false`

=== `slot_name`

The name of the PostgreSQL logical replication slot to use. If not provided, a random name will be generated. You can create this slot manually before starting replication if desired.


*Type*: `string`


```yml
# Examples

slot_name: my_test_slot
```

=== `pg_standby_timeout`

Specify the standby timeout before refreshing an idle connection.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `"10s"`

```yml
# Examples

pg_standby_timeout: 30s
```

=== `pg_wal_monitor_interval`

How often to report changes to the replication lag.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `"3s"`

```yml
# Examples

pg_wal_monitor_interval: 6s
```

=== `max_parallel_snapshot_tables`

Int specifies a number of tables that will be processed in parallel during the snapshot processing stage


*Type*: `int`

*Default*: `1`

=== `unchanged_toast_value`

The value to emit when there are unchanged TOAST values in the stream. This occurs for updates and deletes where REPLICA IDENTITY is not FULL.


*Type*: `unknown`

*Default*: `null`

```yml
# Examples

unchanged_toast_value: __redpanda_connect_unchanged_toast_value__
```

=== `heartbeat_interval`

The interval at which to write heartbeat messages. Heartbeat messages are needed in scenarios when the subscribed tables are low frequency, but there are other high frequency tables writing. Due to the checkpointing mechanism for replication slots, not having new messages to acknowledge will prevent postgres from reclaiming the write ahead log, which can exhaust the local disk. Having heartbeats allows Redpanda Connect to safely acknowledge data periodically and move forward the committed point in the log so it can be reclaimed. Setting the duration to 0s will disable heartbeats entirely. Heartbeats are created by periodically writing logical messages to the write ahead log using `pg_logical_emit_message`.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `"1h"`

```yml
# Examples

heartbeat_interval: 0s

heartbeat_interval: 24h
```

=== `tls`

Custom TLS settings can be used to override system defaults.


*Type*: `object`


=== `tls.skip_cert_verify`

Whether to skip server side certificate verification.


*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `false`

=== `tls.enable_renegotiation`

Whether to allow the remote server to repeatedly request renegotiation. Enable this option if you're seeing the error message `local error: tls: no renegotiation`.


*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `false`
Requires version 3.45.0 or newer

=== `tls.root_cas`

An optional root certificate authority to use. This is a string, representing a certificate chain from the parent trusted root certificate, to possible intermediate signing certificates, to the host certificate.
[CAUTION]
====
This field contains sensitive information that usually shouldn't be added to a config directly, read our xref:configuration:secrets.adoc[secrets page for more info].
====



*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

```yml
# Examples

root_cas: |-
  -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
  ...
  -----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

=== `tls.root_cas_file`

An optional path of a root certificate authority file to use. This is a file, often with a .pem extension, containing a certificate chain from the parent trusted root certificate, to possible intermediate signing certificates, to the host certificate.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

```yml
# Examples

root_cas_file: ./root_cas.pem
```

=== `tls.client_certs`

A list of client certificates to use. For each certificate either the fields `cert` and `key`, or `cert_file` and `key_file` should be specified, but not both.


*Type*: `array`

*Default*: `[]`

```yml
# Examples

client_certs:
  - cert: foo
    key: bar

client_certs:
  - cert_file: ./example.pem
    key_file: ./example.key
```

=== `tls.client_certs[].cert`

A plain text certificate to use.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `tls.client_certs[].key`

A plain text certificate key to use.
[CAUTION]
====
This field contains sensitive information that usually shouldn't be added to a config directly, read our xref:configuration:secrets.adoc[secrets page for more info].
====



*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `tls.client_certs[].cert_file`

The path of a certificate to use.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `tls.client_certs[].key_file`

The path of a certificate key to use.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `tls.client_certs[].password`

A plain text password for when the private key is password encrypted in PKCS#1 or PKCS#8 format. The obsolete `pbeWithMD5AndDES-CBC` algorithm is not supported for the PKCS#8 format.

Because the obsolete pbeWithMD5AndDES-CBC algorithm does not authenticate the ciphertext, it is vulnerable to padding oracle attacks that can let an attacker recover the plaintext.
[CAUTION]
====
This field contains sensitive information that usually shouldn't be added to a config directly, read our xref:configuration:secrets.adoc[secrets page for more info].
====



*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

```yml
# Examples

password: foo

password: ${KEY_PASSWORD}
```

=== `aws`

AWS IAM authentication configuration for PostgreSQL instances. When enabled, IAM credentials are used to generate temporary authentication tokens instead of a static password.


*Type*: `object`


=== `aws.enabled`

Enable AWS IAM authentication for PostgreSQL. When enabled, an IAM authentication token is generated and used as the password.


*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `false`

=== `aws.region`

The AWS region where the PostgreSQL instance is located. If no region is specified then the environment default will be used.


*Type*: `string`


=== `aws.endpoint`

The PostgreSQL endpoint hostname (e.g., mydb.abc123.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com).


*Type*: `string`


=== `auto_replay_nacks`

Whether messages that are rejected (nacked) at the output level should be automatically replayed indefinitely, eventually resulting in back pressure if the cause of the rejections is persistent. If set to `false` these messages will instead be deleted. Disabling auto replays can greatly improve memory efficiency of high throughput streams as the original shape of the data can be discarded immediately upon consumption and mutation.


*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `true`

=== `batching`

Allows you to configure a xref:configuration:batching.adoc[batching policy].


*Type*: `object`


```yml
# Examples

batching:
  byte_size: 5000
  count: 0
  period: 1s

batching:
  count: 10
  period: 1s

batching:
  check: this.contains("END BATCH")
  count: 0
  period: 1m
```

=== `batching.count`

A number of messages at which the batch should be flushed. If `0` disables count based batching.


*Type*: `int`

*Default*: `0`

=== `batching.byte_size`

An amount of bytes at which the batch should be flushed. If `0` disables size based batching.


*Type*: `int`

*Default*: `0`

=== `batching.period`

A period in which an incomplete batch should be flushed regardless of its size.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

```yml
# Examples

period: 1s

period: 1m

period: 500ms
```

=== `batching.check`

A xref:guides:bloblang/about.adoc[Bloblang query] that should return a boolean value indicating whether a message should end a batch.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

```yml
# Examples

check: this.type == "end_of_transaction"
```

=== `batching.processors`

A list of xref:components:processors/about.adoc[processors] to apply to a batch as it is flushed. This allows you to aggregate and archive the batch however you see fit. Please note that all resulting messages are flushed as a single batch, therefore splitting the batch into smaller batches using these processors is a no-op.


*Type*: `array`


```yml
# Examples

processors:
  - archive:
      format: concatenate

processors:
  - archive:
      format: lines

processors:
  - archive:
      format: json_array
```
