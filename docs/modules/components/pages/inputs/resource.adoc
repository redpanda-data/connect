Resource is an input type that channels messages from a resource input, identified by its name.

```yml
# Config fields, showing default values
input:
  resource: ""
```

Resources allow you to tidy up deeply nested configs. For example, the config:

```yaml
input:
  broker:
    inputs:
      - kafka:
          addresses: [ TODO ]
          topics: [ foo ]
          consumer_group: foogroup
      - gcp_pubsub:
          project: bar
          subscription: baz
```

Could also be expressed as:

```yaml
input:
  broker:
    inputs:
      - resource: foo
      - resource: bar

input_resources:
  - label: foo
    kafka:
      addresses: [ TODO ]
      topics: [ foo ]
      consumer_group: foogroup

  - label: bar
    gcp_pubsub:
      project: bar
      subscription: baz
```

Resources also allow you to reference a single input in multiple places, such as multiple streams mode configs, or multiple entries in a broker input. However, when a resource is referenced more than once the messages it produces are distributed across those references, so each message will only be directed to a single reference, not all of them.

You can find out more about resources in xref:configuration:resources.adoc[].
