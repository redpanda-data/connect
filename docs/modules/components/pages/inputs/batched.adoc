Consumes data from a child input and applies a batching policy to the stream.

Introduced in version 4.11.0.

Batching at the input level is sometimes useful for processing across micro-batches, and can also sometimes be a useful performance trick. However, most inputs are fine without it so unless you have a specific plan for batching this component is not worth using.

== Fields

=== `child`

The child input.


*Type*: `input`


=== `policy`

Allows you to configure a xref:configuration:batching.adoc[batching policy].


*Type*: `object`


```yml
# Examples

policy:
  byte_size: 5000
  count: 0
  period: 1s

policy:
  count: 10
  period: 1s

policy:
  check: this.contains("END BATCH")
  count: 0
  period: 1m
```

=== `policy.count`

A number of messages at which the batch should be flushed. If `0` disables count based batching.


*Type*: `int`

*Default*: `0`

=== `policy.byte_size`

An amount of bytes at which the batch should be flushed. If `0` disables size based batching.


*Type*: `int`

*Default*: `0`

=== `policy.period`

A period in which an incomplete batch should be flushed regardless of its size.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

```yml
# Examples

period: 1s

period: 1m

period: 500ms
```

=== `policy.check`

A xref:guides:bloblang/about.adoc[Bloblang query] that should return a boolean value indicating whether a message should end a batch.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

```yml
# Examples

check: this.type == "end_of_transaction"
```

=== `policy.processors`

A list of xref:components:processors/about.adoc[processors] to apply to a batch as it is flushed. This allows you to aggregate and archive the batch however you see fit. Please note that all resulting messages are flushed as a single batch, therefore splitting the batch into smaller batches using these processors is a no-op.


*Type*: `array`


```yml
# Examples

processors:
  - archive:
      format: concatenate

processors:
  - archive:
      format: lines

processors:
  - archive:
      format: json_array
```
