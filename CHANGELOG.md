Changelog
=========

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## 4.39.0 - 2024-11-07

### Added

- New `timeplus` input. (@ye11ow)
- New `snowflake_streaming` output. (@rockwotj)
- Redpanda Connect will now use an optional `/etc/redpanda/connector_list.yaml` config to determine which connectors are available to run. (@Jeffail)
- (Benthos) Field `follow_redirects` added to the `http` processor. (@ooesili)
- New CLI flag `--secrets` added. (@Jeffail)
- New CLI flag `--disable-telemetry` added. (@Jeffail)
- New experimental `spicedb` watch input. (@simon0191)
- New `redpanda_common` input and output. (@Jeffail)
- New `redpanda` input and output. (@Jeffail)
- New `snowflake_streaming` output. (@rockwotj)

### Fixed

- The `kafka`, `kafka_franz` and `redpanda_migrator` outputs no longer waste CPU for large batches. (@rockwotj)

### Changed

- The `aws_sqs` output field `url` now supports interpolation functions. (@rockwotj)
- (Benthos) CLI `--set` flags can now mutate array values indexed from the end via negative integers. E.g. `--set 'foo.-1=meow'` would set the last index of the array `foo` to the value of `meow`. (@Jeffail)

## 4.38.0 - 2024-10-17

### Added

- Anonymous telemetry data is now sent by Connect instances after running for >5 mins. Details about which data is sent, when it is sent, and how to disable it can be found in the [telemetry README](./internal/telemetry/README.md). (@Jeffail)
- Field `checksum_algorithm` added to the `aws_s3` output. (@dom-lee-naimuri)
- Field `nkey` added to `nats`, `nats_jetstream`, `nats_kv` and `nats_stream` components. (@ye11ow)
- Field `private_key` added to the `snowflake_put` output. (@mihaitodor)
- New `azure_data_lake_gen2` output. (@ooesili)
- New `timeplus` output. (@ye11ow)

### Fixed

- The `elasticsearch` output now performs retries for HTTP status code `429` (Too Many Requests). (@kahoowkh)
- The docs for the `collection` field of the `mongodb` output now specify support for interpolation functions. (@mihaitodor)

### Changed

- All components with a default `path` field value (such as the `aws_s3` output) containing the deprecated function `count` have now been changed to use the new function `counter`. This could potentially change behaviour in cases where multiple components are executing a mapping with a `count` function sharing the same of the old default count, and these counters need to cascade. This is an extremely unlikely scenario, but for all users of these components it is recommended that your `path` is defined explicitly, and in a future major version we will be removing the defaults.

## 4.32.1 - 2024-07-24

### Changed

- The number of release build artifacts for the `community` and `cloud` flavours have been reduced due to Github Action Runner disk space limitations.

## 4.32.0 - 2024-07-24

- New `pinecone` output. (@rockwotj)
- (Benthos) The `/ready` endpoint in regular operation now provides a detailed summary of all inputs and outputs, including connection errors where applicable. (@Jeffail)

### Changed

- (Benthos) All cli subcommands that previously relied on root-level flags (`streams`, `lint`, `test`, `echo`) now explicitly define those flags such that they appear in help-text and can be specified _after_ the subcommand itself. This means previous commands such as `connect -r ./foo.yaml streams ./bar.yaml` can now be more intuitively written as `connect streams -r ./foo.yaml ./bar.yaml` and so on. The old style will still work in order to preserve backwards compatibility, but the help-text for these root-level flags has been hidden. (@Jeffail)

## 4.30.1 - 2024-06-13

### Fixed

- AWS Lambda serverless build artifacts have been added back to official releases.

## 4.30.0 - 2024-06-13

- (Benthos) New `sin`, `cos`, `tan` and `pi` bloblang methods. (@mfamador)
- (Benthos) Field `proxy_url` added to the `websocket` input and output. (@mihaitodor)
- New experimental `splunk` input. (@mihaitodor)

### Fixed

- The `sql_insert` and `sql_raw` components no longer fail when inserting large binary blobs into Oracle `BLOB` columns. (@mihaitodor)
- (Benthos) The `websocket` input and output now obey the `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY` and `NO_PROXY` environment variables. (@mihaitodor)

### Changed

- The `splunk_hec` output is now implemented as a native Go component. (@mihaitodor)

## 4.29.0 - 2024-06-04

### Added

- Go API: New packages `public/bundle/free` and `public/bundle/enterprise` with explicit licensing for bundles of component imports.
- Field `auth.oauth2.scope` added to the `pulsar` input and output. (@srenatus)
- Field `subscription_initial_position` added to the `pulsar` input. (@srenatus)

### Fixed

- The `pulsar` input and output should no longer ignore `auth.oauth2` fields. (@srenatus)
- Creating builds using `make` no longer prints warnings when the repository does not contain a tag. (@mkysel)
- Messages resulting from the `redis` processor are no longer invalid when using hash commands. (@mkysel)
- The `nats_jetstream` input no longer fails to initialise when a stream is specified and a subject is not. (@maxarndt)

## 4.28.0 - 2024-05-30

### Changed

- The repository has been moved to `redpanda-data/connect` and no longer contains the core Benthos engine, which is now broken out into `redpanda-data/benthos`.

## 4.27.0 - 2024-04-23

### Added

- New `nats_kv` cache type.
- The `nats_jetstream` input now supports `last_per_subject` and `new` deliver fallbacks.
- Field `error_patterns` added to the `drop_on` output.
- New `redis_scan` input type.
- Field `auto_replay_nacks` added to all inputs that traditionally automatically retry nacked messages as a toggle for this behaviour.
- New `retry` processor.
- New `noop` cache.
- Field `targets_input` added to the `azure_blob_storage` input.
- New `reject_errored` output.
- New `nats_request_reply` processor.
- New `json_documents` scanner.

### Fixed

- The `unarchive` processor no longer yields linting errors when the format `csv:x` is specified. This is a regression introduced in v4.25.0.
- The `sftp` input will no longer consume files when the watcher cache returns an error. Instead, it will reattempt the file upon the next poll.
- The `aws_sqs` input no longer logs error level logs for visibility timeout refreshing errors.
- The `nats_kv` processor now allows [nats wildcards](https://docs.nats.io/nats-concepts/subjects#wildcards) for the `keys` operation.
- The `nats_kv` processor `keys` operation now returns a single message with an array of found keys instead of a batch of messages.
- The `nats_kv` processor `history` operation now returns a single message with an array of objects containing the record fields instead of a batch of messages.
- Field `timeout` added to the `nats_kv` processor to specify the maximum period to wait on an operation before aborting and returning an error.
- Bloblang comparison operators (`>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`) now match the precision of the compared integers when applicable.
- The `parse_form_url_encoded` Bloblang method no longer produces results with an unknown data type for repeated query parameters.
- The `echo` CLI command no longer fails to sanitise configs when encountering an empty `password` field.
- The `sql_insert` and `sql_raw` components no longer fail when inserting large binary blobs into Oracle `BLOB` columns.

### Changed

- The log events from all inputs and outputs when they first connect have been made more consistent and no longer contain any information regarding the nature of their connections.
- Splitting message batches with a `split` processor (or custom plugins) no longer results in downstream error handling loops around nacks. This was previously implemented as a feature to ensure unbounded expanded and split batches don't flood downstream services in the event of a minority of errors. However, introducing more clever origin tracking of errored messages has eliminated the need for this undocumented behaviour.

## 4.26.0 - 2024-03-18

### Added

- Field `credit` added to the `amqp_1` input to specify the maximum number of unacknowledged messages the sender can transmit.
- Bloblang now supports root-level `if` statements.
- New experimental `sql` cache.
- Fields `batch_size`, `sort` and `limit` added to the `mongodb` input.
- Field `idemponent_write` added to the `kafka` output.

### Changed

- The default value of the `amqp_1.credit` input has changed from `1` to `64`.
- The `mongodb` processor and output now support extended JSON in canonical form for document, filter and hint mappings.
- The `open_telemetry_collector` tracer has had the `url` field of gRPC and HTTP collectors deprecated in favour of `address`, which more accurately describes the intended format of endpoints. The old style will continue to work, but eventually will have its default value removed and an explicit value will be required.

### Fixed

- Resource config imports containing `%` characters were being incorrectly parsed during unit test execution. This was a regression introduced in v4.25.0.
- Dynamic input and output config updates containing `%` characters were being incorrectly parsed. This was a regression introduced in v4.25.0.

## 4.25.1 - 2024-03-01

### Fixed

- Fixed a regression in v4.25.0 where [template based components](https://www.benthos.dev/docs/configuration/templating) were not parsing correctly from configs.

## 4.25.0 - 2024-03-01

### Added

- Field `address_cache` added to the `socket_server` input.
- Field `read_header` added to the `amqp_1` input.
- All inputs with a `codec` field now support a new field `scanner` to replace it. Scanners are more powerful as they are configured in a structured way similar to other component types rather than via a single string field, for more information [check out the scanners page](https://www.benthos.dev/docs/components/scanners/about).
- New `diff` and `patch` Bloblang methods.
- New `processors` processor.
- Field `read_header` added to the `amqp_1` input.
- A debug endpoint `/debug/pprof/allocs` has been added for profiling allocations.
- New `cockroachdb_changefeed` input.
- The `open_telemetry_collector` tracer now supports sampling.
- The `aws_kinesis` input and output now support specifying ARNs as the stream target.
- New `azure_cosmosdb` input, processor and output.
- All `sql_*` components now support the `gocosmos` driver.
- New `opensearch` output.

### Fixed

- The `javascript` processor now handles module imports correctly.
- Bloblang `if` statements now provide explicit errors when query expressions resolve to non-boolean values.
- Some metadata fields from the `amqp_1` input were always empty due to type mismatch, this should no longer be the case.
- The `zip` Bloblang method no longer fails when executed without arguments.
- The `amqp_0_9` output no longer prints bogus exchange name when connecting to the server.
- The `generate` input no longer adds an extra second to `interval: '@every x'` syntax.
- The `nats_jetstream` input no longer fails to locate mirrored streams.
- Fixed a rare panic in batching mechanisms with a specified `period`, where data arrives in low volumes and is sporadic.
- Executing config unit tests should no longer fail due to output resources failing to connect.

### Changed

- The `parse_parquet` Bloblang function, `parquet_decode`, `parquet_encode` processors and the `parquet` input have all been upgraded to the latest version of the underlying Parquet library. Since this underlying library is experimental it is likely that behaviour changes will result. One significant change is that encoding numerical values that are larger than the column type (`float64` into `FLOAT`, `int64` into `INT32`, etc) will no longer be automatically converted.
- The `parse_log` processor field `codec` is now deprecated.
- *WARNING*: Many components have had their underlying implementations moved onto newer internal APIs for defining and extracting their configuration fields. It's recommended that upgrades to this version are performed cautiously.
- *WARNING*: All AWS components have been upgraded to the latest client libraries. Although lots of testing has been done, these libraries have the potential to differ in discrete ways in terms of how credentials are evaluated, cross-account connections are performed, and so on. It's recommended that upgrades to this version are performed cautiously.

## 4.24.0 - 2023-11-24

### Added

- Field `idempotent_write` added to the `kafka_franz` output.
- Field `idle_timeout` added to the `read_until` input.
- Field `delay_seconds` added to the `aws_sqs` output.
- Fields `discard_unknown` and `use_proto_names` added to the `protobuf` processors.

### Fixed

- Bloblang error messages for bad function/method names or parameters should now be improved in mappings that use shorthand for `root = ...`.
- All redis components now support usernames within the configured URL for authentication.
- The `protobuf` processor now supports targetting nested types from proto files.
- The `schema_registry_encode` and `schema_registry_decode` processors should no longer double escape URL unsafe characters within subjects when querying their latest versions.

## 4.23.0 - 2023-10-30

### Added

- The `amqp_0_9` output now supports dynamic interpolation functions within the `exchange` field.
- Field `custom_topic_creation` added to the `kafka` output.

- Experimental `extract_tracing_map` field added to the `nats`, `nats_jetstream` and `nats_stream` inputs.
- Experimental `inject_tracing_map` field added to the `nats`, `nats_jetstream` and `nats_stream` outputs.
- New `_fail_fast` variants for the `broker` output `fan_out` and `fan_out_sequential` patterns.

- The `metric` processor now supports floating point values for `counter_by` and `gauge` types.

### Fixed

- Allow labels on caches and rate limit resources when writing configs in CUE.
- Go API: `log/slog` loggers injected into a stream builder via `StreamBuilder.SetLogger` should now respect formatting strings.
- All Azure components now support container SAS tokens for authentication.
- The `kafka_franz` input now provides properly typed metadata values.
- The `trino` driver for the various `sql_*` components no longer panics when trying to insert nulls.
- The `http_client` input no longer sends a phantom request body on subsequent requests when an empty `payload` is specified.
- The `schema_registry_encode` and `schema_registry_decode` processors should no longer fail to obtain schemas containing slashes (or other URL path unfriendly characters).
- The `parse_log` processor no longer extracts structured fields that are incompatible with Bloblang mappings.
- Fixed occurrences where Bloblang would fail to recognise `float32` values.

## 4.22.0 - 2023-10-03

### Added

- The `-e/--env-file` cli flag for importing environment variable files now supports glob patterns.
- Environment variables imported via `-e/--env-file` cli flags now support triple quoted strings.
- New experimental `counter` function added to Bloblang. It is recommended that this function, although experimental, should be used instead of the now deprecated `count` function.
- The `schema_registry_encode` and `schema_registry_decode` processors now support JSONSchema.
- Field `metadata` added to the `nats` and `nats_jetstream` outputs.
- The `cached` processor field `ttl` now supports interpolation functions.
- Many new properties fields have been added to the `amqp_0_9` output.
- Field `command` added to the `redis_list` input and output.

### Fixed

- Corrected a scheduling error where the `generate` input with a descriptor interval (`@hourly`, etc) had a chance of firing twice.
- Fixed an issue where a `redis_streams` input that is rejected from read attempts enters a reconnect loop without backoff.
- The `sqs` input now periodically refreshes the visibility timeout of messages that take a significant amount of time to process.
- The `ts_add_iso8601` and `ts_sub_iso8601` bloblang methods now return the correct error for certain invalid durations.
- The `discord` output no longer ignores structured message fields containing underscores.
- Fixed an issue where the `kafka_franz` input was ignoring batching periods and stalling.

### Changed

- The `random_int` Bloblang function now prevents instantiations where either the `max` or `min` arguments are dynamic. This is in order to avoid situations where the random number generator is re-initialised across subsequent mappings in a way that surprises map authors.

## 4.21.0 - 2023-09-08

### Added

- Fields `client_id` and `rack_id` added to the `kafka_franz` input and output.
- New experimental `command` processor.
- Parameter `no_cache` added to the `file` and `env` Bloblang functions.
- New `file_rel` function added to Bloblang.
- Field `endpoint_params` added to the `oauth2` section of HTTP client components.

### Fixed

- Allow comments in single root and directly imported bloblang mappings.
- The `azure_blob_storage` input no longer adds `blob_storage_content_type` and `blob_storage_content_encoding` metadata values as string pointer types, and instead adds these values as string types only when they are present.
- The `http_server` input now returns a more appropriate 503 service unavailable status code during shutdown instead of the previous 404 status.
- Fixed a potential panic when closing a `pusher` output that was never initialised.
- The `sftp` output now reconnects upon being disconnected by the Azure idle timeout.
- The `switch` output now produces error logs when messages do not pass at least one case with `strict_mode` enabled, previously these rejected messages were potentially re-processed in a loop without any logs depending on the config. An inaccuracy to the documentation has also been fixed in order to clarify behaviour when strict mode is not enabled.
- The `log` processor `fields_mapping` field should no longer reject metadata queries using `@` syntax.
- Fixed an issue where heavily utilised streams with nested resource based outputs could lock-up when performing heavy resource mutating traffic on the streams mode REST API.
- The Bloblang `zip` method no longer produces values that yield an "Unknown data type".

## 4.20.0 - 2023-08-22

### Added

- The `amqp1` input now supports `anonymous` SASL authentication.
- New JWT Bloblang methods `parse_jwt_es256`, `parse_jwt_es384`, `parse_jwt_es512`, `parse_jwt_rs256`, `parse_jwt_rs384`, `parse_jwt_rs512`, `sign_jwt_es256`, `sign_jwt_es384` and `sign_jwt_es512` added.
- The `csv-safe` input codec now supports custom delimiters with the syntax `csv-safe:x`.
- The `open_telemetry_collector` tracer now supports secure connections, enabled via the `secure` field.
- Function `v0_msg_exists_meta` added to the `javascript` processor.

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where saturated output resources could panic under intense CRUD activity.
- The config linter no longer raises issues with codec fields containing colons within their arguments.
- The `elasticsearch` output should no longer fail to send basic authentication passwords, this fixes a regression introduced in v4.19.0.

## 4.19.0 - 2023-08-17

### Added

- Field `topics_pattern` added to the `pulsar` input.
- Both the `schema_registry_encode` and `schema_registry_decode` processors now support protobuf schemas.
- Both the `schema_registry_encode` and `schema_registry_decode` processors now support references for AVRO and PROTOBUF schemas.
- New Bloblang method `zip`.
- New Bloblang `int8`, `int16`, `uint8`, `uint16`, `float32` and `float64` methods.

### Fixed

- Errors encountered by the `gcp_pubsub` output should now present more specific logs.
- Upgraded `kafka` input and output underlying sarama client library to v1.40.0 at new module path github.com/IBM/sarama
- The CUE schema for `switch` processor now correctly reflects that it takes a list of clauses.
- Fixed the CUE schema for fields that take a 2d-array such as `workflow.order`.
- The `snowflake_put` output has been added back to 32-bit ARM builds since the build incompatibilities have been resolved.
- The `snowflake_put` output and the `sql_*` components no longer trigger a panic when running on a readonly file system with the `snowflake` driver. This driver still requires access to write temporary files somewhere, which can be configured via the Go [`TMPDIR`](https://pkg.go.dev/os#TempDir) environment variable. Details [here](https://github.com/snowflakedb/gosnowflake/issues/700).
- The `http_server` input and output now follow the same multiplexer rules regardless of whether the general `http` server block is used or a custom endpoint.
- Config linting should now respect fields sourced via a merge key (`<<`).
- The `lint` subcommand should now lint config files pointed to via `-r`/`--resources` flags.

### Changed

- The `snowflake_put` output is now beta.
- Endpoints specified by `http_server` components using both the general `http` server block or their own custom server addresses should no longer be treated as path prefixes unless the path ends with a slash (`/`), in which case all extensions of the path will match. This corrects a behavioural change introduced in v4.14.0.

## 4.18.0 - 2023-07-02

### Added

- Field `logger.level_name` added for customising the name of log levels in the JSON format.
- Methods `sign_jwt_rs256`, `sign_jwt_rs384` and `sign_jwt_rs512` added to Bloblang.

### Fixed

- HTTP components no longer ignore `proxy_url` settings when OAuth2 is set.
- The `PATCH` verb for the streams mode REST API no longer fails to patch over newer components implemented with the latest plugin APIs.
- The `nats_jetstream` input no longer fails for configs that set `bind` to `true` and do not specify both a `stream` and `durable` together.
- The `mongodb` processor and output no longer ignores the `upsert` field.

### Changed

- The old `parquet` processor (now superseded by `parquet_encode` and `parquet_decode`) has been removed from 32-bit ARM builds due to build incompatibilities.
- The `snowflake_put` output has been removed from 32-bit ARM builds due to build incompatibilities.
- Plugin API: The `(*BatchError).WalkMessages` method has been deprecated in favour of `WalkMessagesIndexedBy`.

## 4.17.0 - 2023-06-13

### Added

- The `dynamic` input and output have a new endpoint `/input/{id}/uptime` and `/output/{id}/uptime` respectively for obtaining the uptime of a given input/output.
- Field `wait_time_seconds` added to the `aws_sqs` input.
- Field `timeout` added to the `gcp_cloud_storage` output.
- All NATS components now set the name of each connection to the component label when specified.

### Fixed

- Restore message ordering support to `gcp_pubsub` output. This issue was introduced in 4.16.0 as a result of [#1836](https://github.com/benthosdev/benthos/pull/1836).
- Specifying structured metadata values (non-strings) in unit test definitions should no longer cause linting errors.

### Changed

- The `gcp_pubsub` output should see significant performance improvements due to a client library upgrade.
- The stream builder APIs should now follow `logger.file` config fields.
- The experimental `cue` format in the cli `list` subcommand no longer introduces infinite recursion for `#Processors`.
- Config unit tests no longer execute linting rules for missing env var interpolations.

## 4.15.0 - 2023-05-05

### Added

- Flag `--skip-env-var-check` added to the `lint` subcommand, this disables the new linting behaviour where environment variable interpolations without defaults throw linting errors when the variable is not defined.
- The `kafka_franz` input now supports explicit partitions in the field `topics`.
- The `kafka_franz` input now supports batching.
- New `metadata` Bloblang function for batch-aware structured metadata queries.
- Go API: Running the Benthos CLI with a context set with a deadline now triggers graceful termination before the deadline is reached.
- Go API: New `public/service/servicetest` package added for functions useful for testing custom Benthos builds.
- New `lru` and `ttlru` in-memory caches.

### Fixed

- Provide msgpack plugins through `public/components/msgpack`.
- The `kafka_franz` input should no longer commit offsets one behind the next during partition yielding.
- The streams mode HTTP API should no longer route requests to `/streams/<stream-ID>` to the `/streams` handler. This issue was introduced in v4.14.0.

## 4.14.0 - 2023-04-25

### Added

- The `-e/--env-file` cli flag can now be specified multiple times.
- New `studio pull` cli subcommand for running [Benthos Studio](https://studio.benthos.dev) session deployments.
- Metadata field `kafka_tombstone_message` added to the `kafka` and `kafka_franz` inputs.
- Method `SetEnvVarLookupFunc` added to the stream builder API.
- The `discord` input and output now use the official chat client API and no longer rely on poll-based HTTP requests, this should result in more efficient and less erroneous behaviour.
- New bloblang timestamp methods `ts_add_iso8601` and `ts_sub_iso8601`.
- All SQL components now support the `trino` driver.
- New input codec `csv-safe`.
- Added `base64rawurl` scheme to both the `encode` and `decode` Bloblang methods.
- New `find_by` and `find_all_by` Bloblang methods.
- New `skipbom` input codec.
- New `javascript` processor.

### Fixed

- The `find_all` bloblang method no longer produces results that are of an `unknown` type.
- The `find_all` and `find` Bloblang methods no longer fail when the value argument is a field reference.
- Endpoints specified by HTTP server components using both the general `http` server block or their own custom server addresses should now be treated as path prefixes. This corrects a behavioural change that was introduced when both respective server options were updated to support path parameters.
- Prevented a panic caused when using the `encrypt_aes` and `decrypt_aes` Bloblang methods with a mismatched key/iv lengths.
- The `snowpipe` field of the `snowflake_put` output can now be omitted from the config without raising an error.
- Batch-aware processors such as `mapping` and `mutation` should now report correct error metrics.
- Running `benthos blobl server` should no longer panic when a mapping with variable read/writes is executed in parallel.
- Speculative fix for the `cloudwatch` metrics exporter rejecting metrics due to `minimum field size of 1, PutMetricDataInput.MetricData[0].Dimensions[0].Value`.
- The `snowflake_put` output now prevents silent failures under certain conditions. Details [here](https://github.com/snowflakedb/gosnowflake/issues/701).
- Reduced the amount of pre-compilation of Bloblang based linting rules for documentation fields, this should dramatically improve the start up time of Benthos (~1s down to ~200ms).
- Environment variable interpolations with an empty fallback (`${FOO:}`) are now valid.
- Fixed an issue where the `mongodb` output wasn't using bulk send requests according to batching policies.
- The `amqp_1` input now falls back to accessing `Message.Value` when the data is empty.

### Changed

- When a config contains environment variable interpolations without a default value (i.e. `${FOO}`), if that environment variable is not defined a linting error will be emitted. Shutting down due to linting errors can be disabled with the `--chilled` cli flag, and variables can be specified with an empty default value (`${FOO:}`) in order to make the previous behaviour explicit and prevent the new linting error.
- The `find` and `find_all` Bloblang methods no longer support query arguments as they were incompatible with supporting value arguments. For query based arguments use the new `find_by` and `find_all_by` methods.

## 4.13.0 - 2023-03-15

### Added

- Fix vulnerability [GO-2023-1571](https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-1571)

- The `open_telemetry_collector` tracer now automatically sets the `service.name` and `service.version` tags if they are not configured by the user.
- New bloblang string methods `trim_prefix` and `trim_suffix`.

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where messages caught in a retry loop from inputs that do not support nacks (`generate`, `kafka`, `file`, etc) could be retried in their post-mutation form from the `switch` output rather than the original copy of the message.
- The `sqlite` buffer should no longer print `Failed to ack buffer message` logs during graceful termination.
- The default value of the `conn_max_idle` field has been changed from 0 to 2 for all `sql_*` components in accordance
to the [`database/sql` docs](https://pkg.go.dev/database/sql#DB.SetMaxIdleConns).
- The `parse_csv` bloblang method with `parse_header_row` set to `false` no longer produces rows that are of an `unknown` type.

- The `avro-ocf:marshaler=json` input codec now omits unexpected logical type fields.
- Fixed a bug in the `sql_insert` output (see commit c6a71e9) where transaction-based drivers (`clickhouse` and `oracle`) would fail to roll back an in-progress transaction if any of the messages caused an error.
- The `resource` input should no longer block the first layer of graceful termination.

### Changed

- The `catch` method now defines the context of argument mappings to be the string of the caught error. In previous cases the context was undocumented, vague and would often bind to the outer context. It's still possible to reference this outer context by capturing the error (e.g. `.catch(_ -> this)`).
- Field interpolations that fail due to mapping errors will no longer produce placeholder values and will instead provide proper errors that result in nacks or retries similar to other issues.

## 4.10.0 - 2022-10-26

### Added

- The `nats_jetstream` input now adds a range of useful metadata information to messages.

- New `find` and `find_all` bloblang array methods.

### Fixed

- The `gcp_cloud_storage` output no longer ignores errors when closing a written file, this was masking issues when the target bucket was invalid.
- Upgraded the `kafka_franz` input and output to use github.com/twmb/franz-go@v1.9.0 since some [bug fixes](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v190) were made recently.

- The `--labels` linting option no longer flags resource components.

## 4.9.1 - 2022-10-06

### Added

- Go API: A new `BatchError` type added for distinguishing errors of a given batch.

### Fixed

- Rolled back `kafka` input and output underlying sarama client library to fix a regression introduced in 4.9.0 😅 where `invalid configuration (Consumer.Group.Rebalance.GroupStrategies and Consumer.Group.Rebalance.Strategy cannot be set at the same time)` errors would prevent consumption under certain configurations. We've decided to roll back rather than upgrade as a breaking API change was introduced that could cause issues for Go API importers (more info here: https://github.com/Shopify/sarama/issues/2358).

## 4.9.0 - 2022-10-03

### Added

- New `parquet` input for reading a batch of Parquet files from disk.

- The `cassandra` output now inserts logged batches of data rather than the less efficient (and unnecessary) unlogged form.

## 4.8.0 - 2022-09-30

### Added

- All `sql` components now support Oracle DB.

### Fixed

- All SQL components now accept an empty or unspecified `args_mapping` as an alias for no arguments.

- The `/inputs` and `/outputs` endpoints for dynamic inputs and outputs now correctly render configs, both structured within the JSON response and the raw config string.
- Go API: The stream builder no longer ignores `http` configuration. Instead, the value of `http.enabled` is set to `false` by default.

## 4.5.1 - 2022-08-10

### Fixed

- Reverted `kafka_franz` dependency back to `1.3.1` due to a regression in TLS/SASL commit retention.

- Fixed structural cycle in the CUE representation of the `retry` output.
- Tracing headers from HTTP requests to the `http_server` input are now correctly extracted.

### Changed

- The `broker` input no longer applies processors before batching as this was unintentional behaviour and counter to documentation. Users that rely on this behaviour are advised to place their pre-batching processors at the level of the child inputs of the broker.
- The `broker` output no longer applies processors after batching as this was unintentional behaviour and counter to documentation. Users that rely on this behaviour are advised to place their post-batching processors at the level of the child outputs of the broker.

## 4.4.1 - 2022-07-19

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where an `http_server` input or output would fail to register prometheus metrics when combined with other inputs/outputs.

- Go API: Fixed an issue where running the CLI API without importing a component package would result in template init crashing.
- The `http` processor and `http_client` input and output no longer have default headers as part of their configuration.

- Ability to write logs to a file (with optional rotation) instead of stdout.

### Fixed

- The default docker image no longer throws configuration errors when running streams mode without an explicit general config.
- The field `metrics.mapping` now allows environment functions such as `hostname` and `env`.
- Fixed a lock-up in the `amqp_0_9` output caused when messages sent with the `immediate` or `mandatory` flags were rejected.
- Fixed a race condition upon creating dynamic streams that self-terminate, this was causing panics in cases where the stream finishes immediately.

## 4.0.0 - 2022-04-20

This is a major version release, for more information and guidance on how to migrate please refer to [https://benthos.dev/docs/guides/migration/v4](https://www.benthos.dev/docs/guides/migration/v4).

- The `schema_registry_decode` processor now handles AVRO logical types correctly. Details in [#1198](https://github.com/benthosdev/benthos/pull/1198) and [#1161](https://github.com/benthosdev/benthos/issues/1161) and also in https://github.com/linkedin/goavro/issues/242.

### Changed

- All components, features and configuration fields that were marked as deprecated have been removed.
- The `pulsar` input and output are no longer included in the default Benthos builds.
- The field `pipeline.threads` field now defaults to `-1`, which automatically matches the host machine CPU count.
- Old style interpolation functions (`${!json:foo,1}`) are removed in favour of the newer Bloblang syntax (`${! json("foo") }`).
- The Bloblang functions `meta`, `root_meta`, `error` and `env` now return `null` when the target value does not exist.
- The `clickhouse` SQL driver Data Source Name format parameters have been changed due to a client library update. This also means placeholders in `sql_raw` components should use dollar syntax.
- Docker images no longer come with a default config that contains generated environment variables, use `-s` flag arguments instead.

- All cache components that support a general default TTL now have a field `default_ttl` with a duration string, replacing the previous field.
- The `http` processor and `http_client` output now execute message batch requests as individual requests by default. This behaviour can be disabled by explicitly setting `batch_as_multipart` to `true`.
- Outputs that traditionally wrote empty newlines at the end of batches with >1 message when using the `lines` codec (`socket`, `stdout`, `file`, `sftp`) no longer do this by default.
- The `switch` output field `retry_until_success` now defaults to `false`.
- All AWS components now have a default `region` field that is empty, allowing environment variables or profile values to be used by default.
- Serverless distributions of Benthos (AWS lambda, etc) have had the default output config changed to reject messages when the processing fails, this should make it easier to handle errors from invocation.
- The standard metrics emitted by Benthos have been largely simplified and improved, for more information [check out the metrics page](https://www.benthos.dev/docs/components/metrics/about).
- The default metrics type is now `prometheus`.
- The `http_server` metrics type has been renamed to `json_api`.
- The `stdout` metrics type has been renamed to `logger`.
- The `logger` configuration section has been simplified, with `logfmt` being the new default format.
- The `logger` field `add_timestamp` is now `false` by default.
- Field `parts` has been removed from all processors.
- Field `max_in_flight` has been removed from a range of output brokers as it no longer required.
- The `dedupe` processor now acts upon individual messages by default, and the `hash` field has been removed.
- The `log` processor now executes for each individual message of a batch.
- The `sleep` processor now executes for each individual message of a batch.

- Increased the offset commit API version used by the `kafka` input to v0.8.2 when consuming explicit partitions.

### Changed

- Go API: Component implementations now require explicit import from `./public/components/all` in order to be invokable. This should be done automatically at all plugin and custom build entry points. If, however, you notice that your builds have begun complaining that known components do not exist then you will need to explicitly import the package with `_ "github.com/Jeffail/benthos/v3/public/components/all"`, if this is the case then please report it as an issue so that it can be dealt with.

### Fixed

- Add `Content-Type` headers in streams API responses.
- Field `delete_objects` is now respected by the experimental `aws_s3` input.
- Fixed a case where resource processors couldn't access rate limit resources.
- Input files that are valid according to the codec but empty now trigger acknowledgements.
- Mapping `deleted()` within Bloblang object and array literals now correctly omits the values.

## 3.34.0 - 2020-11-20

### New

- New field `format` added to `logger` supporting `json` and `logfmt`.
- The `file` input now provides the metadata field `path` on payloads.

### Fixed

- The `output.sent` metric now properly represents the number of individual messages sent even after archiving batches.
- Fixed a case where metric processors in streams mode pipelines and dynamic components would hang.
- Sync responses of >1 payloads should now get a correct rfc1341 multipart header.
- The `cassandra` output now correctly marshals float and double values.
- The `nanomsg` input with a `SUB` socket no longer attempts to set invalid timeout.

## 3.33.0 - 2020-11-16

### Added

- Added field `codec` to the `file` output.
- The `file` output now supports dynamic file paths.
- Added field `ttl` to the `cache` processor and output.
- New `sql` output, which is similar to the `sql` processor and currently supports Clickhouse, PostgreSQL and MySQL.
- The `kafka` input now supports multiple topics, topic partition balancing, and checkpointing.
- New `cassandra` output.
- Field `allowed_verbs` added to the `http_server` input and output.
- New bloblang function `now`, and method `parse_timestamp`.
- New bloblang methods `floor` and `round`.
- The bloblang method `format_timestamp` now supports strings in ISO 8601 format as well as unix epochs with decimal precision up to nanoseconds.

## Changed

- The `files` output has been deprecated as its behaviour is now covered by `file`.
- The `kafka_balanced` input has now been deprecated as its functionality has been added to the `kafka` input.
- The `cloudwatch` metrics aggregator is now considered stable.
- The `sequence` input is now considered stable.
- The `switch` processor no longer permits cases with no processors.

## Fixed

- Fixed the `tar` and `tar-gzip` input codecs in experimental inputs.
- Fixed a crash that could occur when referencing contextual fields within interpolation functions.
- The `noop` processor can now be inferred with an empty object (`noop: {}`).
- Fixed potential message corruption with the `file` input when using the `lines` codec.

## 3.32.0 - 2020-10-29

### Added

- Bloblang maps now work when running bloblang with the `blobl` subcommand.

### Changed

- The `ristretto` cache no longer forces retries on get commands, and the retry fields have been changed in order to reflect this behaviour.
- The `files` input has been deprecated as its behaviour is now covered by `file`.
- Numbers within JSON documents are now parsed in a way that preserves precision even in cases where the number does not fit a 64-bit signed integer or float. When arithmetic is applied to those numbers (either in Bloblang or by other means) the number is converted (and precision lost) at that point based on the operation itself.

  This change means that string coercion on large numbers (e.g. `root.foo = this.large_int.string()`) should now preserve the original form. However, if you are using plugins that interact with JSON message payloads you must ensure that your plugins are able to process the [`json.Number`](https://golang.org/pkg/encoding/json/#Number) type.

  This change should otherwise not alter the behaviour of your configs, but if you notice odd side effects you can disable this feature by setting the environment variable `BENTHOS_USE_NUMBER` to `false` (`BENTHOS_USE_NUMBER=false benthos -c ./config.yaml`). Please [raise an issue](https://github.com/Jeffail/benthos/issues/new) if this is the case so that it can be looked into.

## 3.31.0 - 2020-10-15

### Added

- New output `subprocess`.
- Field `auto_ack` added to the `amqp_0_9` input.
- Metric labels can be renamed for `prometheus` and `cloudwatch` metrics components using `path_mapping` by assigning meta fields.

### Fixed

## 3.30.0 - 2020-10-06

### Added

- OAuth 2.0 using the client credentials token flow is now supported by the `http_client` input and output, and the `http` processor.

### Changed

- The default value for `batching.count` fields is now zero, which means adding a non-count based batching mechanism without also explicitly overriding `count` no longer incorrectly caps batches at one message. This change is backwards compatible in that working batching configs will not change in behaviour. However, a broken batching config will now behave as expected.

### Fixed

- Improved Bloblang parser error messages for function and method parameters.

## 3.28.0 - 2020-09-14

### Added

- New methods `any`, `all` and `json_schema` added to Bloblang.

- The `workflow` processor can now reference resource configured `branch` processors.
- The `metric` processor now has a field `name` that replaces the now deprecated field `path`. When used the processor now applies to all messages of a batch and the name of the metric is now absolute, without being prefixed by a path generated based on its position within the config.
- New field `check` added to `group_by` processor children, which now replaces the old `condition` field.
- New field `check` added to `while` processor, which now replaces the old `condition` field.

- New beta `jq` processor.
- New driver `clickhouse` added to the `sql` processor.

### Changed

- New field `data_source_name` replaces `dsn` for the `sql` processor, and when using this field each message of a batch is processed individually. When using the field `dsn` the behaviour remains unchanged for backwards compatibility.

### Fixed

- Eliminated situations where an `amqp_0_9` or `amqp_1` component would abandon a connection reset due to partial errors.
- The Bloblang parser now allows naked negation of queries.
- The `cache` processor interpolations for `key` and `value` now cross-batch reference messages before processing.

## 3.26.0 - 2020-08-30

### Added

- New Bloblang methods `not_null` and `filter`.

- The `conditional`, `process_map` and `process_dag` processors are now deprecated and are superseded by the `switch`, `branch` and `workflow` processors respectively.

### Fixed

- Batching fields added to `s3` output.

### Changed

- The `http` processor field `max_parallel` has been deprecated in favour of rate limits, and the fields within `request` have been moved to the root of the `http` namespace. This change is backwards compatible and `http.request` fields will still be recognized until the next major version release.
- The `process_field` processor is now deprecated, and `branch` should be used instead.

### Fixed

- Wholesale metadata mappings (`meta = {"foo":"bar"}`) in Bloblang now correctly clear pre-existing fields.
